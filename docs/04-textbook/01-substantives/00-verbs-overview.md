## Verbs - Definition

Latin, like English, has several **parts of speech** into which words can be classified. The first part of speech under consideration is the **verb**, defined here as a word that indicates **action** or a **state of being**. Take a look at the following examples in English:

* The defendant **showed** the evidence.
* You **had** my attention.
* The story **was** very long.
* The victims **were wronged**.

In each of these sentences, the verb is bolded and serves as the anchor of the entire sentence, communicating the idea that the sentence is trying to convey. Note that the verb can indicate **action** ("showed", "had", "were wronged") or a **static state** ("was"). We'll learn more about these distinctions as the semester continues.

## Verb Aspects

Verbs can appear in different forms, including **infinitives** (verbal nouns, like "to make" or "to do") or **participles** (verbal adjectives, like "making" or "done"). For this first part of the semester, however, we'll be focusing mostly on verbs that are **conjugated** (more on this in a bit).

As discussed in [the page on inflection](../basics/inflection#conjugation), we can change the endings of verbs to reflect different aspects of the verb through a process called **conjugation**. A conjugated verb, then, exhibits five major **aspects** that we can glean through **the verb's ending** and **the verb stem** to which that ending is attached. Through this combination of stem and ending, we can figure out such aspects of a verb as who performs the verb's action and how many of the actor there are.

The following is a broad overview of verbal aspects that we can identify through a verb's stem and ending. We will reinforce these ideas as the semester continues, so do not worry if you're overwhelmed by all of these ideas now.

1. **person**. The **person** of a verb indicates the relationship of the speaker of the sentence to the subject.
    * **1st person** means that the speaker *is* the subject or is part of a group that serves as the subject. This is most often indicated through pronouns like "I" or "me" in the singular or "we" or "us" in the plural.
    * **2nd person** means that the speaker is *addressing* the subject. This is most often indicated through pronouns like "you" (singular or plural) or "you all / y'all" (only plural).
    * **3rd person** means that the speaker is talking about someone that is neither the speaker nor the addressee. This is often indicated through pronouns like "he, she, it, they" as subjects or "him, her, it, them" as objects. Also, a third-person subject can be explicitly named. For example, "**The bees** make honey" or "**The sky** is blue" -- both "the bees" and "the sky" are examples of third-person subjects.

2. **number**. The **number** of a verb indicates how many of the subject there are.
    * **singular** indicates that there is just one of the subject. For example: "**The boy** kicks the ball" has a singular subject, "the boy."
    * **plural** indicates that there are more than one of the subject. For example: "**The boys** kick the balls" has a plural subject, "the boys."
<br><br>
3. **tense**. The **tense** of a verb indicates *when* the action of the verb occurs.
    * **perfect** tense indicates that the action of the verb happened instantaneously, at one single point, in the past (e.g., "She **tripped** and **fell**."). It can also indicate that an action occurred in the past but has lasting effects into the present (e.g., "He **has died**" [the implication being that he died in the past and he's still dead at the current moment]).
    * **imperfect** tense indicates that the action of the verb occurred continuously, over a period of time, in the past. Note the difference between the **perfect** and the **imperfect**; the former is a single point, like a photograph ("She **fell**"), while the latter takes place over a period of time, like a video ("She **was falling**").
    * **present** tense indicates that the action of the verb is happening *now*.
    * **future** tense indicates that the action of the verb will occur later but hasn't happened yet.
    * **pluperfect** tense indicates that the action of the verb occurred *before* another event in the past. For example, "he *had died* before the war ended" -- his death came before the war ended, and he was still dead when the war did end.
    * **future perfect** tense indicates that the action of the verb will have occurred *before* another event in the future but will have lasting effects into that future moment. For example, "he *will have died* before the war will end" -- his death will come before the war's end, and it will last into that future moment.
<br><br>
4. **voice**. The **voice** of a verb indicates the relationship of the subject to the action of the verb.
  * The verb's voice is **active** if the subject *performs* the action of the verb. For example, "The boy **loves** the girl." The boy performs the action of loving.
  * The verb's voice is **passive** if the subject *receives* the action of the verb. For example, "The girl **is loved** by the boy." The girl *receives* the action of loving, even though she is the subject, so the verb is considered passive.
<br><br>
5. **mood**. The **mood** of a verb indicates how the speaker thinks about the quality of the verb's action.
  * **indicative** mood indicates that the speaker considers the verb's action a definite fact.
  * **imperative** mood indicates that the speaker considers the verb's action a command.
  * **subjunctive** mood indicates that the speaker considers the verb's action as less definite, a possibility rather than an established fact.

These five aspects apply mainly to **conjugated verbs**, here defined as verbs with a **person** and a **number**. We may also refer to **conjugated verbs** as **finite verbs**, since we limit (or make finite) the verb by giving it a subject with a person and a number. Other verbal forms exhibit only some of the aspects (e.g., infinitives and participles both have tense and voice but not person or mood); we will deal with those in later lessons.

So, in sum, a **finite verb** has some combination of the following five aspects:

1. **person**: 1st, 2nd, 3rd
2. **number**: singular, plural
3. **tense**: perfect, imperfect, present, future, pluperfect, future perfect
4. **voice**: active, passive
5. **mood**: indicative, imperative, subjunctive

The act of identifying the five aspects of a conjugated verb is called **parsing**. So, if I were asked to parse the verb **habuit**, I would answer: 3rd singular perfect active indicative. (We'll learn much more about parsing and identification in the coming days.)

## Dictionary Entry

When you are learning verbs in Latin, you must memorize the way that the verb's entry appears in a dictionary, such as in the [Complete Vocabulary](../../vocabulary/complete) for this very textbook. You'll notice that entries for verbs have five parts: the first four, in Latin, are called **principal parts** and the fifth, in English, is the definition of the verb.

Here are two examples:

* amō, amāre, amāvī, amātus - to love 
* videō, vidēre, vīdī, vīsus - to see; (passive) to seem

Each of the **principal parts** gives you the stem for the verb's forms in certain tenses and voices. Here's an overview:

| Principal Part | Form of Verb | What You Can Conjugate With It |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1st | 1st sg. present | present, imperfect, and future tense forms in both voices |
| 2nd | present active infinitive | present, imperfect, and future tense forms in both voices |
| 3rd | 1st sg. perfect | perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect active forms |
| 4th | perfect passive participle | perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect passive forms |

Not all verbs have all four principal parts. In such cases, there will be a -- in the places where the verb does not have a principal part. For example:

* possum, posse, potuī, -- - to be able to, can

### Conjugation

The dictionary entry of a verb also indicates a group to which it belongs that dictates what kind of endings we can use to conjugate the verb in question. Confusingly, these groups are called **conjugations**, and there are four and a half major conjugations of Latin verbs. You can tell the conjugation of a verb by specifically looking at its **second principal part**, a form known as the **present active infinitive**, and looking specifically at the letters in which the second principal part ends:

* **1st conjugation verbs** have a 2nd principal part that ends in **-āre**.
* **2nd conjugation verbs** have a 2nd principal part that ends in **-ēre**.
* **3rd conjugation verbs** have a 2nd principal part that ends in **-ere** (without a long mark over the e); note that pure 3rd conjugation verbs also have a **1st principal part** that ends just in the letter **-ō**.
* **3rd -iō conjugation verbs** have a 2nd principal part that ends in **-ere** ***but also*** a **1st principal part** that ends in **-iō**.
* **4th conjugation verbs** have a 2nd principal part that ends in **-īre**.
