## Pronouns

A **pronoun** (from Latin *prō*, "in place of", + *nōmen*, "name" and the Latin word for a noun) is a word that takes the place of a **noun** to vary up a narrative and reduce monotony. For example, imagine the following narrative:

* The boy saw the trees. The boy walked to the trees, and the boy sat under the trees.

The repetitions of "the boy" and "the tree" make for a boring narrative. But we can substitute in various **pronouns** for the second and third appearances of each noun, with certain aspects of each pronoun making it clear that they refer back to the boy and the tree. For example:

* The boy saw the trees. **He** walked to **them**, and **he** sat under **them**.

"He" and "them" are pronouns that take the place of "boy" and "trees" respectively, and certain aspects of each pronoun make it clear to which noun they refer. For example, "he" indicates a masculine singular entity, while "them" refers to a plural entity. One boy and multiple trees make it clear to which nouns "he" and "them" refer.

Latin **pronouns**, like nouns and adjectives, have a **gender, case, and number**, the options for each of which are the same as those for nouns and adjectives (e.g., masculine, feminine, or neuter for gender). The **gender** and the **number** of a pronoun is determined by the noun to which the pronoun refers, which is called the pronoun's **antecedent** (from Latin *ante*, "before", and *cedere*, "to go"; thus, an antecedent is the noun that *goes before* the pronoun). The pronoun used in place of the noun must have the same **gender** and **number** as the antecedent. This works the same in Latin as in English. Think, for example, about the following pronoun subtitutions:

- The boy throws the ball. **He** throws the ball.
- We listened to the teacher. We listened to **her**.
- The students took the exam. **They** took the exam.

"He", "her", and "they" exhibit the same **gender** and **number** of their antecedents ("the boy", "the teacher", and "the students" respectively).

The same rules apply in Latin. For example, you would use *ea* (feminine nominative singular of *is, ea, id* -- see below) to substitute for *mater* (feminine nominative singular) and *is* (masculine nominative singular of *is, ea, id* -- see below) to substitute for *pater* (masculine nominative singular).

This also applies for nouns that are not typically biologically gendered. For the Latin word for table (*mensa, mensae, f. - "table"*), you would use *ea* as the pronoun because the noun is feminine (although we might think it's neuter because it's a table). Remember that a noun's gender is a static fact that you have to memorize with the dictionary entry.

Note, however, that although a pronoun must agree with its antecedent in **gender** and in **number**, it doesn't necessarily need to match in **case** because a pronoun can fulfill a different function/use within its sentence than the original antecedent fulfilled within its sentence. Take a look at the following English example:

* **The boy** sat under the trees. I saw **him**.

The pronoun "him" refers back to "the boy" as its antecedent. However, although "the boy" is the subject of the first sentence, "him" is the direct object of the second sentence. While the pronoun agrees with the noun in gender and in number (masculine singular), its case would necessarily be different; while "the boy" would be a nominative subject, "him" would have to be an accusative direct object.

There are different kinds of pronouns that fulfill different functions and are translated in different ways. In this unit, we will consider two types of pronouns and specific examples of them: **personal pronouns** and **reflexive pronouns**.

## 3rd Person Personal Pronouns

A **personal pronoun** is a pronoun that indicates an entity related to the person of a verb. For example, examples of the **1st person personal pronoun** include English pronouns like "I" or "me" in the singular and "we" or "us" in the plural, while examples of the **2nd person personal pronoun** include English pronouns like "you" or "y'all."

Here, we will consider the **3rd person personal pronoun**: **is, ea, id**, which translates in its various forms, depending on its gender, number, and case, to English pronouns like "he"/"him", "she/her", "it", and "they/them". 

Because pronouns, like adjectives, need to be able to cover a variety of gender-number-case combinations that could be present in nouns, paradigm charts for pronouns can be as large as those for adjectives. Often, however, the declension of pronouns can seem irregular and less straightforward than the find-the-stem-and-attach-an-ending pattern that we've been working with so far. Take a look, for example, at the paradigm chart for **is, ea, id**:

|  | **Masculine** | **Feminine** | **Neuter** |
| --- | --- | --- | -- |
| **Nom. Sg.** | is | ea | id |
| **Gen. Sg.** | eius | eius | eius |
| **Dat. Sg.** | eī | eī | eī |
| **Acc. Sg.** | eum | eam | id |
| **Abl. Sg.** | eō | eā | eō |
| **Nom. Pl.** | eī / iī | eae | ea |
| **Gen. Pl.** | eōrum | eārum | eōrum |
| **Dat. Pl.** | eīs | eīs | eīs |
| **Acc. Pl.** | eōs | eās | ea |
| **Abl. Pl.** | eīs | eīs | eīs |

While most forms seem to be built with the stem **e-** and 1st/2nd declension endings, note exceptions like **is** and **id**. In addition, note how the genitive singular and dative singular across all three genders decline like an -īus adjective (**eius** and **eī**).

Recall that the pronoun has to match its antecedent in **gender** and **number**, though not necessarily case. Thus, when you're trying to find the antecedent of a pronoun, you have to be aware of all the gender and number possibilities for the nouns that come before the pronoun. For example:

* puellae taurum duxērunt. mater eās vīdit.

In this sentence, the pronoun **eās** refers back to some antecedent that we have to identify to get the right picture of what's happening in our heads. **eās** has to be **feminine accusative plural**, and in terms of nouns that come before **eās**, our options are **puellae** or **taurum**. Based on the nouns' genders and numbers, we can rule out **taurum** (*masculine singular*) as an antecedent for **eās** (*feminine plural*) and understand that it is the **girls** that the mother saw:

* The girls led the bull. The mother saw **them** [meaning 'the girls'].

## 3rd Person Reflexive Pronouns

Another type of pronoun that is related to the person of a verb is the **reflexive pronoun**, which is a pronoun in a non-nominative case that refers back to the subject of the sentence ("reflexive" from the Latin verb *reflectere* "to bend back"). In English, reflexives are usually translated as with the suffix **-self** or **-selves**:

- I love *myself*.
- You teach *yourself* Latin.
- I gave a present to *myself*.
- They helped *themselves*.

For first and second person pronouns in Latin, the form of the reflexive pronoun is the *same* as the personal pronoun. You can find the charts for [1st and 2nd person reflexive pronouns here](../../reference/pronouns-paradigms/#reflexive). Below are some examples:

- *mē* amō. ("I love *myself*.")
- *tē* amās. ("You love *yourself*.")
- *vōbīs* donum datis. ("You all are giving a gift *to yourselves".)
- *nōs* īuvāmus. ("We help ourselves.")

Note how the **person of the verb** and the **person of the pronoun** match, which makes the pronoun a reflexive rather than just a personal pronoun. For example:

- *mē* amō. I love *myself.* (1st person verb, 1st person pronoun = reflexive)
- *mē* amās. You love *me.* (2nd person verb, 1st person pronoun = personal)

Things get a little trickier in the case of the third person pronoun. While there is no ambiguity in first and second pronouns (that is, "I"/"me" and "you" are always self-explanatory), there can be ambiguity in the third person pronoun (there are lots of possible hims and hers). As a result, Latin, like English, differentiates between the regular pronoun (*is, ea, id*) and the reflexive (*suī* = genitive, *sibi* = dative, *sē* = accusative, *sē* = ablative). Here is the [third person reflexive pronoun](../../reference/pronouns-paradigms/#3rd-person-himself-herself-itself-themselves) in paradigm form, and here are some examples of the differences between using *is, ea, id* and *suī, sibi, sē, sē*:

- Amat eam. ("She loves her.")
- Amat sē. ("She loves herself.")
- Donum eī dat. ("He gives a gift to him" (i.e., a person other than himself))
- Donum sibi dat. ("He gives a gift to himself.")

Note the differences here. When you use *is, ea, id*, you are referring to someone *other than* the subject. So, in "*amat eam*", the subject "she" is not the same person as the direct object "her." By using the reflexive in the second sentence, though, you make it clear that the direct object "herself" *is the same person as* the subject "she."

Interestingly, the same forms are used for both the **singular** and **plural** 3rd person reflexive pronoun. This is because all reflexives refer back to their subject, and thus, there is no ambiguity between singular and plural.

- Amat sē. ("She loves herself.")
- Amant sē. ("They love themselves.")
