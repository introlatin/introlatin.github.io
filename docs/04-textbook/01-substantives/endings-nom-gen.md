## Noun Endings

While the **gender** of nouns cannot be changed, the **case** and **number** of nouns does change to reflect a noun's different functions within a sentence (**case**) and how many there are of the noun (**number**). These different case-number combinations are indicated by the use of certain **endings** that get applied to a noun's stem. As discussed in the [nouns overview](nouns-overview), the specific ending used to reflect a certain case-number combination depends on the noun's **declension**. As a reminder, we determine a noun's declension based on the ending of its **second principal part** in its dictionary entry:

| Declension | Ending of 2nd Principal Part | 
| --- | --- |
| 1st | -ae |
| 2nd | -ī |
| 3rd | -is |

(We'll learn about the 4th and 5th declension in a later lesson.)

The second principal part also gives us that noun's **stem** -- we take off that ending (**-ae**, **-ī**, or **-is**), and we use what is left of the noun to attach appropriate endings for the noun's case and number.

The endings that can be applied to reflect different cases and numbers in nouns are as follows. We'll discuss the specific uses of each case later on; for now, this is simply about rote morphology and learning how each of the case-number combinations can appear in the 1st through 3rd declensions. 

**These endings must be memorized.** Having them in your head rather than needing to look them up every time you need to check the case and number of a noun will save you a lot of time and stress in the long run.

### 1st Declension

All nouns in the first declension will use the following endings:

|  | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | -a | -ae |
| Genitive | -ae | -ārum |
| Dative | -ae | -īs |
| Accusative | -am | -ās |
| Ablative | -ā | -īs |

Note the **macron** (long mark) over the **-ā** in the ablative singular: this is an important long mark that will be the only way to differentiate the ablative singular from the nominative singular. Note also the endings that can be used in multiple instances: **-ae** for genitive singular, dative singular, and nominative plural; and **-īs** for dative plural and ablative plural. We'll learn much more about how to use context to tell these apart later.

Here is an example of a full declension chart of a first declension noun: **puella, puellae, f. - girl**. We first need to determine the noun's stem by removing the ending from the 2nd principal part, leaving us with the stem **puell-**. Then, we can add the appropriate endings.

|  | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | puell**a** | puell**ae** |
| Genitive | puell**ae** | puell**ārum** |
| Dative | puell**ae** | puell**īs** |
| Accusative | puell**am** | puell**ās** |
| Ablative | puell**ā** | puell**īs** |

### 2nd Declension

There are two sets of endings for second declension nouns depending on the noun's **gender**, whether it's masculine/feminine or neuter.

#### 2nd Declension Masculine/Feminine

|  | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | -us / -r | -ī |
| Genitive | -ī | -ōrum |
| Dative | -ō | -īs |
| Accusative | -um | -ōs |
| Ablative | -ō | -īs |

As in the 1st declension, note the endings that are used in multiple places: **-ī** for genitive singular and nominative plural, **-ō** for dative and ablative singular, and **-īs** for dative plural and ablative plural.

Here is an example of a full declension chart of a 2nd declension masculine noun: **puer, puerī, m. - boy**, with the stem **puer-**:

|  | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | puer | puer**ī** |
| Genitive | puer**ī** | puer**ōrum** |
| Dative | puer**ō** | puer**īs** |
| Accusative | puer**um** | puer**ōs** |
| Ablative | puer**ō** | puer**īs** |

#### 2nd Declension Neuter

|  | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | -um | -a |
| Genitive | -ī | -ōrum |
| Dative | -ō | -īs |
| Accusative | -um | -a |
| Ablative | -ō | -īs |

The endings for 2nd declension neuter are mostly similar to those of 2nd declension masculine/feminine except for the nominative singular (**-um**) and the nominative and accusative plural (**-a**). This is our first example of an important rule: **in a neuter noun, adjective, or pronoun, the nominative singular and accusative singular will be exactly identical, as will the nominative plural and accusative plural**.

Here is an example of a full declension chart of a 2nd declension neuter noun: **oppidum, oppidī, n. - town**, with the stem **oppid-**:

|  | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | oppid**um** | oppid**a** |
| Genitive | oppid**ī** | oppid**ōrum** |
| Dative | oppid**ō** | oppid**īs** |
| Accusative | oppid**um** | oppid**a** |
| Ablative | oppid**ō** | oppid**īs** |

### 3rd Declension

The 3rd declension, like the 2nd declension, has two sets of endings depending on the noun's **gender**, masculine/feminine or neuter.

#### 3rd Declension Masculine/Feminine

|  | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | -- | -ēs |
| Genitive | -is | -um |
| Dative | -ī | -ibus |
| Accusative | -em | -ēs |
| Ablative | -e | -ibus |

The -- in the nominative singular means that there is a lot of variety in nominative singular forms of 3rd declension nouns; there is no one set ending. As usual, note the duplications: **-ēs** in the nominative and accusative plural and **-ibus** in the dative and ablative plural.

Here is an example of a full declension chart of a 3rd declension masculine noun: **dux, ducis, m. - leader**, with the stem **duc-**:

|  | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | dux | duc**ēs** |
| Genitive | duc**is** | duc**um** |
| Dative | duc**ī** | duc**ibus** |
| Accusative | duc**em** | duc**ēs** |
| Ablative | duc**e** | duc**ibus** |

#### 3rd Declension Neuter

|  | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | -- | -a |
| Genitive | -is | -um |
| Dative | -ī | -ibus |
| Accusative | [same as nom.] | -a |
| Ablative | -e | -ibus |

The accusative singular of a 3rd declension neuter noun will look **exactly** like the nominative singular form, however it's spelled, due to the rule mentioned above. Other forms that differ from 3rd declension masculine/feminine include the nominative and accusative plural (**-a**).

Here is an example of a full declension chart of a 3rd declension neuter noun: **nōmen, nōminis, n. - name**, with the stem **nōmin-**:

|  | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Nominative | nōmen | nōmin**a** |
| Genitive | nōmin**is** | nōmin**um** |
| Dative | nōmin**ī** | nōmin**ibus** |
| Accusative | nōmen | nōmin**a** |
| Ablative | nōmin**e** | nōmin**ibus** |

## Cases and Uses

While the **number** of a noun is self-evident (there's either one of the noun [**singular**] or more than one [**plural**]), the **case** of a noun needs more explanation. Recall that case tells us how a noun *functions* within a sentence. For example, in the following sentence:

* The boy kicks the ball.

each of the two nouns, **boy** and **ball**, fulfills a different function in the sentence. The boy performs the action of kicking; this makes the boy the **subject**. The ball, on the other hand, receives the action of kicking; this makes the ball the **direct object**.

These functions get assigned to specific **cases** in Latin. Each function is called a **use**. Each of the cases has multiple **uses**, and you will need to use context often to determine which use is the most appropriate for the sentence under consideration. 

In this and the next chapter, we'll consider only the core **uses** of each of the cases; we'll add more uses to each case as the semester continues.

## Nominative

The primary use of the **nominative** is to indicate that a noun is the **subject** of a sentence's verb. 

## Genitive
