## Prepositional Phrases

In Latin, **prepositions** (like the English words "in", "into", "with", or "to") are *indeclinable* words followed by a noun in the **ablative** or **accusative** (called the **object of the preposition** or **prepositional object**). This unit consisting of preposition and the object of the preposition is called a **prepositional phrase**.

The **preposition** (from Latin **prae**, "before", and -position coming from the verb **ponere**, "to place" or "to put"; thus, a preposition is a word that is *placed before* a noun) serves as a bridge word that connects the prepositional object to another entity in the sentence to give more context to it. It can, for example, explain which noun is being talked about or how the action of the verb occurs. Here are some English examples, with the prepositional phrase in bold:

* The book **on the table** is heavy.
    * The prepositional phrase "on the table" explains which book is being talked about -- the book *on the table*, as opposed to the book *on the shelf* or *under the folder*.
* The book was placed **on the table**.
    * The same prepositional phrase "on the table" is now being used to give more context to the action of the verb: **where** was the book placed? *On the table.*

Put differently, prepositional phrases add more information about the main action of the sentence or substantive elements of the sentence by answering questions like where, why, which one, and how:

* nauta puellam **in urbe** vīdit. ("The sailor saw the girl in the city.")
    * **Where** did the sailor see the girl? *In the city*. ***or*** **Which girl** did he see? The girl *who was in the city*.
* **ob īgnem** fūgit. ("He fled because of the fire.")
    * **Why** did he flee? *Because of the fire*.
* Hercules monstra **sub ponte** interfēcit. ("Hercules killed the monsters under the bridge.) 
    * **Which** monsters did Hercules kill? The ones under the bridge. OR **Where** did Hercules kill the monsters? Under the bridge.

Each preposition is tied to a specific case that can be used as its prepositional object. For example, **ob** ("because of") can take only substantives in the **accusative case** as its object. In order to tell which case a preposition can take as its object, you must memorize its **dictionary entry**, which will include a marker like "**(+ abl.)**" for ablative prepositions or "**(+ acc.)**" for accusative prepositions. Note the following examples:

* ob - (+ acc.) because of
* sub - (+ abl.) under

One notable exception is the preposition **in**, which can take either the ablative or the accusative as an object and which means something different depending on the case that follows it:

* in - (+ abl.) in, on; (+ acc.) into

Thus:

* puella **in templō** dormīvit. "The girl slept **in the temple**."

BUT:

* puella **in templum** cucurrit. "The girl ran **into the temple**."

One mnemonic device that can help you remember which prepositions take the **ablative case** is the phrase: **SID P. SPACE TAKES THE ABLATIVE CASE**:

S - **sub** - under  
I - **in** - in, on  
D - **dē** - about, down from  
P - **prō** - in front of, on behalf of, in place of  
S - **sine** - without  
P - **prae** - before  
A - **ab/ā** - (away) from [**ab** before a word that begins with a vowel; **ā** otherwise]  
C - **cum** - with  
E - **ex/ē** - out of [**ex** before a word that begins with a vowel; **ē** otherwise]

## Expressions of Place

Latin uses the accusative and ablative case frequently with prepositions to express ideas related to **physical space and place**, particularly in terms of spaces **into which**, **where**, and **out of which** verbal actions occur.

Below are the different expressions of place used in Latin, expressed as new **uses** of the accusative or ablative casees. The names of the uses are hopefully self-explanatory, since you can picture the direction of the action occurring based on the name:

### Accusative of Place to Which or Accusative of Motion Toward

The **accusative of place to which** or **accusative of motion toward** is an accusative substantive used with an accusative preposition like *ad*, *trāns*, or *in* to express that a verbal action is occurring towards or into a certain direction. For example:

- fīlia **ad pātrem** cucurrit. ("The daughter ran **towards her father**.")
- nautae **in urbem** vēnērunt. ("The sailors came **into the city**.")

The **accusative of place to which / motion toward** is almost always used with a verb that indicates physical motion; for example, *venīre*, "to come", or *currere*, "to run."

### Ablative of Place in Which or Ablative of Place Where

The **ablative of place in which** or **ablative of place where** is an ablative substantive used with an ablative preposition like *in* ("in, on"), *prō* ("in front of"), or *sub* ("under") to express that a verbal action is occurring in or within a certain space. For example:

* puella **in mensā** librum posuit. ("The girl placed the book **on the table**.")
* puer **sub arbōribus** sēdit. ("The boy sat **under the trees**.")
* vir mala **prō templō** fēcit. ("The man did bad things **in front of the temple**.")

### Ablative of Place from Which or Ablative of Motion Away From

The **ablative of place from which** or **ablative of motion away from** is an ablative substantive used with an ablative preposition like *ab/ā* ("away from") or *ex/ē* ("out of") to express that a verbal action is occurring away from a certain space. For example:
* virī **ab urbe** fūgērunt. ("The men fled **away from the city**.")
* equī **ex agrīs** cucurrērunt. ("The horses ran **out of the fields**.")

The **ablative of place from which / motion away from** is almost always used with a verb that indicates physical motion, like *fugere*, "to flee", or *currere*, "to run."

## Expressions of Time

The accusative and ablative cases (without prepositions) can also be used to express ideas related to time. You can often spot these uses if the accusative or ablative in question is a word that relates to time: for example,

- *annus, -ī*, m., "year"
- *lux, lucis*, f., "light" (as in "daylight" for a time of day)
- *mensis, -is*, m., "month"
- *nox, noctis*, f., "night"
- *hora, -ae*, f., "hour"

In each of the time expressions below, note that in translation, we have to **insert prepositions into our translation** to make the translation make sense. They are *not* explicitly in the Latin as they were in expressions of place, so we have to identify the specific time expression to translate it correctly.

Below are the ways that Latin expresses ideas of time:

### Accusative of Extent/Length/Duration of Time

The **accusative of extent/length/duration of time** indicates *how long* a verbal action takes place for. The translation will often supply the preposition **"for"**:

* mater **ūnam noctem** dormīvit. ("The mother slept **for one night**." [i.e., *for the duration of* one night]).
* rex populō dōna **ūnum annum** dedit. ("The king gave gifts to the people **for one year**.").

Note that although this use of the accusative does not have a Latin preposition in front of it and thus might be confused with an **accusative direct object**, the presence of a time word (like **noctem** or **annum**) or a more plausible object for the verb (like **dōna**, "gifts", as the things being given in the second sentence) can help you differentiate between the uses.

### Ablative of Time When

The **ablative of time when** indicates *at what specific point in time* a verbal action takes place. The translation will often supply prepositions like **"on", "in", or "at"**:

* **illā nocte** equus ab agrīs cucurrit. ("**On that night**, the horse ran away from the fields.")
* pater **primā luce** surrexit. ("The father woke up **at first light**.")

### Ablative of Time Within Which

The **ablative of time within which** indicates *within what range of time* a verbal action takes place. As opposed to the ablative of time when, the **ablative of time within which** emphasizes a range of time **within which** an action occurred, rather than indicating a specific point in time. As a result, the translation will often supply prepositions like **"within" or "in"**, and you'll need to use context to determine whether you're looking at an ablative of time when versus an ablative of time within which.

* **primō annō** rex oppidum vīcit. ("**In the first year**, the king conquered the town.") [i.e., the action of conquering happened some time within the 365 days of the first year]
* **prīmā mense** agricolae ad urbem vēnērunt. ("**Within the first month**, the farmers came into the city.")

The **ablative of time within which** species a *range* of time within which something happened, while the **ablative of time when** pinpoints an exact time at which the verb happened. There can be some slippage between the two depending on how you interpret the time expression. For example, in the sentence:

* **illā nocte** equus ab agrīs cucurrit.

used above as an example of an **ablative of time when** ("The horse ran away from the fields **on that night**"), we might also interpret *illā nocte* as an **ablative of time within which**, yielding the translation "The horse ran away from the fields **within that night**." Only the context of sentences around the sentence in question can help you figure out which use is more appropriate.
