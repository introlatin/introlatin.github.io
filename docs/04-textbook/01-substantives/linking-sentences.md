## Linking Sentences

The verbs with which we've been working so far are either **transitive verbs** or **intransitive verbs**; the former means that the verb expects some kind of direct object (e.g., "The man **saw** the road"), while the latter means that the verb does not need an object to complete its meaning (e.g., "The man slept"). A transitive verb leads us to expect an accusative somewhere in the sentence to serve as a direct object; for example, in the sentence **vir cēpit aurum**, leaving it at "The man took" would leave us wondering, "what did he take?" The answer comes in the accusative direct object **aurum**: "The man took **the gold**."

This unit introduces a new kind of verb: a **linking** verb, so called because it *links* the subject with a word in the **predicate** (the part of the sentence that includes the verb and anything that follows it) that describes or modifies the subject. The most common linking verb in both English and in Latin is the verb **"to be"**, the dictionary entry for which in Latin is as follows:

**sum, esse, fuī, futūrus - to be**
