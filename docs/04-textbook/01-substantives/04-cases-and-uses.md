## Cases and Uses

While the **gender** of a noun is assigned according to its dictionary entry and the **number** of a noun is self-evident (there's either one of the noun [**singular**] or more than one [**plural**]), the **case** of a noun needs more explanation. Recall that case tells us how a noun *functions* within a sentence. For example, in the following sentence:

* The boy kicks the ball.

each of the two nouns, **boy** and **ball**, fulfills a different function in the sentence. The boy performs the action of kicking; this makes the boy the **subject**. The ball, on the other hand, receives the action of kicking; this makes the ball the **direct object**.

These functions get assigned to specific **cases** in Latin. Each function is called a **use**. Each of the **cases** has multiple **uses**, and you will need to use context often to determine which use is the most appropriate for the sentence under consideration. 

In this chapter, we'll consider only the core **uses** of each of the cases; we'll add more uses to each case as the semester continues.

### Nominative

The primary use of the **nominative** is to indicate that a noun is the **subject** of a sentence's verb. For an active voice verb, this means that the subject performs the verb's action; for a passive voice verb, this means that the subject receives the verb's action. Take a look at the following examples, with the **nominative subject** and its translation in bold in each:

* **The boy** saw the road.
    * **puer** viam vīdit.

* **The road** was seen by the boy.
    * **via** ā puerō vīsa est.\*

\* This sentence contains a perfect passive verb and an ablative of agent, constructions that we'll learn about later on; this is simply here to illustrate how a **nominative subject** is still used with a passive verb, even if the subject receives the verb's action.

We will encounter the other major use of the nominative case, the **predicate nominative**, later on.

### Genitive

The **genitive** case at its core indicates some kind of connection between two nouns. A common way to translate the genitive is by using the preposition **"of"** with the genitive noun; we can supply this "of" in translation even though the genitive noun is only one word, and there will not be an explicit word in Latin to render as "of." Also, a genitive usually appears next to or near the noun that it's attached to.

One of the most common connections is **possession**; i.e., we use the genitive case to indicate that one noun possesses or has ownership of another. A **genitive of possession** can thus be translated with the "of" mentioned above or with an appropriate indication of possession in English, **'s** at the end of a noun not ending in -s or simply **'** at the end of a noun already ending in -s.

Take a look at the following examples, with the genitive noun and its translation in bold in each:

* nōmen **puellae**
    * the name **of the girl** *or* the **girl's** name

* aurum **nautārum**
    * the gold **of the sailors** *or* the **sailors'** gold

We will encounter other uses of the genitive later on.

### Accusative

We'll go slightly out of order of the noun ending paradigm here to discuss the **accusative** case first, the primary use of which is to indicate that a noun is a **direct object** which receives the action of an **transitive active voice verb**. "Active voice" means that the subject of the verb performs the verb's action; "transitive" means that the verb's definition leads us to expect that action to be performed upon an object. For example:

* She **sees** the road.
* They **took** the money.

Compare that against examples of **intransitive verbs**, the definitions of which do not usually lead us to expect the verb to be performed upon something:

* He **slept** soundly.
* The horse **stood** in the fields.

All of this to say: you cannot have an accusative direct object without a transitive active voice verb. Note the following examples, with the **accusative direct object** in bold in each:

* dux **nautās** vīdit.
    * The leader saw **the sailors**.

* pater fīliō **nōmen** dedit.
    * The father gave **a name** to his son.

### Dative

Note how in that last example, two nouns get affected by the action of giving: **nōmen**, "name", and **fīliō**, "son." "Name" *directly* receives the action of giving (it is the thing that is being given), and thus, it is an accusative direct object. "Son", however, gets indirectly affected by the verb's action without receiving the action of giving directly. Thus, it is an **indirect object**, and we use the **dative** case to indicate that. 

One verb that makes it easy to see the role of the indirect object, in both English and Latin, is the verb **dō, dare, dedī, datus - to give**. Latin grammarians in antiquity thought so, too: we have borrowed our term from the Latin *dativus casus*, "the case connected with giving." 

In English, we can express the indirect object either by word order or with a preposition such as **"to"** or **"for"**. Note the following examples with the **dative indirect object** highlighted in bold in each:

* pater **fīliō** nōmen dedit.
    * The father gave a name **to his son**.
    * The father gave **his son** a name.

* puellae **equīs** cībum dedērunt.
    * The girls gave food **to the horses**.
    * The girls gave **the horses** food.

### Ablative

The **ablative** case is extremely versatile and capacious, with many uses that we'll encounter throughout the course of the semester. At its core, the ablative indicates a sense of separation (the term 'ablative' derives from the Latin verb *abferō*, "to carry away"), but it can perform a variety of functions including serving as the object of prepositions and indicating the actor of a passive verb. We'll explore these uses with examples later on.
