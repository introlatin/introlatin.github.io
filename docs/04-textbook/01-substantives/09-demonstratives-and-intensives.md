## Demonstratives

In the last unit, you learned about [personal and reflexive pronouns](personal-and-reflexive-pronouns). There are other kinds of pronouns that indicate a different kind of relationship to the antecedents that the pronouns are replacing; we'll encounter two new ones in this unit.

For example, there are irregular pronouns called **demonstratives** that serve to **point out** something that is nearby or far away from the speaker (from the Latin *demonstrāre*, "to point out"). Note that these pronouns can stand on their own, or they can also function as **adjectives** that modify an explicit noun. If a pronoun, we can sometimes treat it like a [substantive adjective](3rd-declension-adjectives#substantives) and supply a word like "man/men", "woman/women", "person/people", or "thing/things", depending on the gender and number of the pronoun, if our translation calls for it.

### hic, haec, hoc

The demonstrative **hic, haec, hoc** - "this, these", points out something that is **close to** or **nearby** the speaker.

- *hic puer*, "this boy"
- *haec puellae*, "these girls"
- *hoc oppidum*, "this town"
- *hic* (masculine nominative singular), "this man" or "this person"
- *hī* (masculine nominative plural), "these men" or "these people"

As mentioned above, though, the declension of **hic, haec, hoc** is irregular, as perhaps you can already tell from the -c ending on the nominative singular forms. Here is the declension chart:

| | **Masculine** | **Feminine** | **Neuter** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Nom. Sg.** | hic | haec | hoc |
| **Gen. Sg.** | huius | huius | huius |
| **Dat. Sg.** | huic | huic | huic |
| **Acc. Sg.** | hunc | hanc | hoc |
| **Abl. Sg.** | hōc | hāc | hōc |
| **Nom. Pl.** | hī | hae | haec |
| **Gen. Pl.** | hōrum | hārum | hōrum |
| **Dat. Pl.** | hīs | hīs | hīs |
| **Acc. Pl.** | hōs | hās | haec |
| **Abl. Pl.** | hīs | hīs | hīs |

Some items of note:
* Like **is, ea, id** and **-īus** adjectives, **hic** has the same form across all three genders in the genitive singular (**huius**), dative singular (**huic**), dative plural (**hīs**), and ablative plural (**hīs**).
* The macron (long mark) in the masculine and neuter ablative singular (**hōc**) is the only thing we can use to differentiate that form from the neuter nominative and accusative singular (**hoc**, with a short o).
* The form **haec** appears in the feminine nominative singular, neuter nominative plural, and neuter accusative plural.

Again, the demonstratives can be used as either a **pronoun**, which stands alone, or as an **adjective**, which modifies an explicit noun. The latter allows you to match the form of **hic** with a noun in gender, case, and number, but the former asks you to use the pronoun's **gender and number** to supply a word in translation. Here are some examples:

* puer **hōs taurōs** duxit. "The boy led **these bulls**."
* puella nōmina **hōrum** audīvit. "The girl heard the names **of these people**." or "The girl heard the names **of these men**." (**hōrum** = masculine genitive plural)
* agricola **hoc oppidum** relīquit. "The farmer left **this town**."
* agricola **haec** fēcit. "The farmer did **these things**." (**haec** = neuter accusative plural)

### ille, illa, illud

The demonstrative **ille, illa, illud**, "that, those", points out something that is **far away from** the speaker.

- *illī puerī*, "those boys"
- *illa puella*, "that girl"
- *illud oppidum*, "that town"
- *illae* (feminine nominative plural), "those women"
- *illa*, "that woman" (if feminine nominative singular) or "those things" (if neuter nominative/accusative plural)

Like **hic, haec, hoc**, **ille, illa, illud** is declined irregularly:

| | **Masculine** | **Feminine** | **Neuter** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Nom. Sg.** | ille | illa | illud |
| **Gen. Sg.** | illīus | illīus | illīus |
| **Dat. Sg.** | illī | illī | illī |
| **Acc. Sg.** | illum | illam | illud |
| **Abl. Sg.** | illō | illā | illō |
| **Nom. Pl.** | illī | illae | illa |
| **Gen. Pl.** | illōrum | illārum | illōrum |
| **Dat. Pl.** | illīs | illīs | illīs |
| **Acc. Pl.** | illōs | illās | illa |
| **Abl. Pl.** | illīs | illīs | illīs |

The declension of **ille** follows more regular 2-1-2 ending patterns than **hic** does, with some exceptions:
* Note the -ud ending on the neuter nominative and accusative singular (**illud**).
* **ille** declines like an **-īus** adjective in the **genitive singular** (**illīus**) and the **dative singular** (**illī**).
* Note the macron on the -ā in the feminine ablative singular (**illā**), as that is the only way to differentiate it from **illa** in the feminine nominative singular, neuter nominative plural, and the neuter accusative plural.

The use of **ille** indicates distance between the speaker and the object to which they are referring; while "this"or "these" as translations for **hic** indicate proximity, **"that"** or **"those"** for **ille** indicate distance:

* puer **illās arbōrēs** vīdit. "The boy saw **those trees**."
* puellae nōmen **illīus** audīvērunt. "The girls heard the name **of that man/woman/person**." (**illīus** = masculine/feminine/neuter genitive singular)
* agricola **illud oppidum** relīquit. "The farmer left **that town**."
* agricola nautae **illa** dedit. "The farmer gave **those things** to the sailor." (**illa** = neuter accusative plural)

Forms of **hic** and **ille** can also be used together to indicate "the former ... the latter" with *ille* first and *hic* second:

* puer equōs duxit, et puella dormīvit. pater **hanc** nōn vīdit, sed **illum** vīdit.
    * The boy led the horses, and the girl slept. The father did not see **the latter**, but he did see **the former**.
    * (**hanc** = feminine accusative singular, with **puella** as its antecedent; **illum** = masculine accusative singular, with **puer** as its antecedent)

Think about why this makes sense! *ille* points to something that is far away, so in this use, it points to the item in a series that is farther away in distance in the sentence, i.e., "the former", as opposed to "the latter", which is closer.

## Intensives

Another kind of pronoun (that can either stand on its own as a pronoun or function as an adjective that modifies an explicit noun) is the **intensive** or **intensifying** pronoun, **ipse, ipsa, ipsum**, that draws special attention to the word being modified or the pronoun itself. You can imagine that the intensive turns the noun that it modifies or replaces into boldface type or underlines it or puts exclamation points above it to draw your attention to it. It can be translated as "the [noun] him/her/itself/themselves" or "the very [noun]." Take a look at the following examples:

- *ipse puer*, "the boy himself" or "the very boy"
- *ipsa puella*, "the girl herself" or "the very girl"
- *ipsa oppida*, "the towns themselves" or "the very towns"

The paradigm chart looks similar to that of **ille**:

| | **Masculine** | **Feminine** | **Neuter** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Nom. Sg.** | ipse | ipsa | ipsum |
| **Gen. Sg.** | ipsīus | ipsīus | ipsīus |
| **Dat. Sg.** | ipsī | ipsī | ipsī |
| **Acc. Sg.** | ipsum | ipsam | ipsum |
| **Abl. Sg.** | ipsō | ipsā | ipsō |
| **Nom. Pl.** | ipsī | ipsae | ipsa |
| **Gen. Pl.** | ipsōrum | ipsārum | ipsōrum |
| **Dat. Pl.** | ipsīs | ipsīs | ipsīs |
| **Acc. Pl.** | ipsōs | ipsās | ipsa |
| **Abl. Pl.** | ipsīs | ipsīs | ipsīs |

If you use the translation "the very [noun]", be careful not to confuse this adjective with the common adverb "very", as in "They are very happy." In addition, do not confuse the "-self" translations with the **reflexive pronoun** that you learned about in [the last unit](personal-and-reflexive-pronouns). The **intensive** serves to underline or put a big exclamation point over the noun that it's modifying or replacing; the **reflexive** specifically refers back to the subject of the sentence. 

Note the following examples, using proper names Marcus and Titus (which decline as second declension nouns) to show the difference between the intensive and the reflexive:

* Marcus **Titum ipsum** vīdit. "Marcus saw **Titus himself**" or "Marcus saw **the very Titus**"
    * **ipsum** functions as an intensive adjective here, emphasizing or intensifying **Titum**.

* Marcus **ipsum** vīdit. "Marcus saw **the man himself** / **the person themself**" (if **ipsum** = masc. acc. sg.) or "Marcus saw **the thing itself**" (if **ipsum** = neut. acc. sg.)
    * **ipsum** functions as an intensive pronoun that emphasizes a different entity other than Marcus, the subject. Even if you consider **ipsum** masculine singular, it *cannot* reflect the action of **vīdit** back at Marcus. For that, you'd need the reflexive:

* Marcus **sē** vīdit. "Marcus saw **himself**."
    * **sē**, a reflexive pronoun, indicates that the object of **vīdit** is the same person as the subject (i.e., Marcus).
