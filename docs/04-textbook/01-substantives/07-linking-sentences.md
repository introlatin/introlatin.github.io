## Linking Sentences

The verbs with which we've been working so far are either **transitive verbs** or **intransitive verbs**; the former means that the verb expects some kind of direct object (e.g., "The man **saw** the road"), while the latter means that the verb does not need an object to complete its meaning (e.g., "The man slept").

A **transitive verb** leads us to expect an **accusative** somewhere in the sentence to serve as a **direct object**; for example, in the sentence **vir cēpit aurum**, leaving it at "The man took" would leave us wondering, "what did he take?" The answer comes in the accusative direct object **aurum**: "The man took **the gold**." 
 
**Intransitive verbs**, on the other hand, do not need an object to complete their meaning. For example, in the sentence **equī cucurrērunt**, the action of running in **cucurrērunt** is a complete thought in and of itself; we can leave the translation at "The horses ran" without any desire for a direct object to 'finish' the sentence.

This unit introduces a new kind of verb beyond the transitive and intransitive: a **linking** verb, so called because it *links* the subject with a word in the **predicate** (the part of the sentence that includes the verb and anything that follows it) that describes or modifies the subject. The most common linking verb in both English and in Latin is the verb **"to be"**, the dictionary entry for which in Latin is as follows:

**sum, esse, fuī, futūrus - to be**

In the perfect active, this verb is completely regular: we can use our familiar **-it** ending for 3rd person singular and **-ērunt / -ēre** ending for 3rd person plural to create conjugated verbs:

* puer **fuit**: "The boy **was**" or "The boy **has been**"
* puerī **fuērunt**: "The boys **were**" or "The boys **have been**"

The present system tenses (present, imperfect, and future) will involve irregular conjugations, but we'll encounter those in the second part of the semester.

Linking verbs, like transitive verbs, lead us to expect something in the predicate, but while transitive verbs expect a direct object, linking verbs expect a word or words to be linked back to the subject to describe the subject: the boy was what? the boys were what? The answer to that question comes in a new **use** of the **nominative case**: the **predicate nominative**.

## Predicate Nominative

The **predicate nominative** is a **use** of the nominative specifically in a sentence with a **linking verb**. Its function is to describe the **subject** via the linking verb intervening in between. Accordingly, a predicate nominative can be a **noun**, an **adjective**, or a **pronoun**.

If the predicate nominative is a noun, it will necessarily need to be in the nominative case and often match in **number** with the subject. For example:

* fēminae fuērunt **mātrēs**. "The women were **mothers**."
* fēmina fuit **mater**. "The woman was **a mother**."

If the predicate nominative is an adjective, it still follows the rules of **adjective-noun agreement**; this means that the predicate nominative adjective has to be in the same **gender, case, and number** as the subject:

* aqua fuit **frigida**. "The water was **cold**."
* equī fuērunt **pulchrī**. "The horses were **beautiful**."
* oppidum fuit **magnum**. "The town was **large**."

Note that since word order doesn't dictate function, it *is* technically possible to construe the preceding sentences with the adjective directly modifying the subject: "The cold water was", "the beautiful horses were", and "the large town was." However, the linking verb sets up an expectation of something to come after it -- you're left wanting more. 

If you see a form of **sum, esse, fuī, futūrus**, odds are good that there's a **predicate nominative** somewhere in the sentence, and you can use context and common sense to see which word it is.

We will handle pronouns when we learn about them next week, but as a quick preview, pronouns, like adjectives, will take on a gender and a number based on the noun to which they refer. Case can change depending on context, but 

* pater fuit **hic**. "The father was **this man**."
* fīliae fuērunt **illae**. "The daughters were **those women**."
