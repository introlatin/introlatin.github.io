## Cases and Uses

While the **number** of a noun is self-evident (there's either one of the noun [**singular**] or more than one [**plural**]), the **case** of a noun needs more explanation. Recall that case tells us how a noun *functions* within a sentence. For example, in the following sentence:

* The boy kicks the ball.

each of the two nouns, **boy** and **ball**, fulfills a different function in the sentence. The boy performs the action of kicking; this makes the boy the **subject**. The ball, on the other hand, receives the action of kicking; this makes the ball the **direct object**.

These functions get assigned to specific **cases** in Latin. Each function is called a **use**. Each of the **cases** has multiple **uses**, and you will need to use context often to determine which use is the most appropriate for the sentence under consideration. 

In this chapter, we'll consider only the core **uses** of each of the cases; we'll add more uses to each case as the semester continues.

### Nominative

The primary use of the **nominative** is to indicate that a noun is the **subject** of a sentence's verb. For an active voice verb, this means that the subject performs the verb's action; for a passive voice verb, this means that the subject receives the verb's action. Take a look at the following examples, with the **nominative subject** and its translation in bold in each:

* **The boy** saw the road.
    * **puer** viam vīdit.

* **The road** was seen by the boy.
    * **via** ā puerō vīsa est.\*

\* This sentence contains a perfect passive verb and an ablative of agent, constructions that we'll learn about later on; this is simply here to illustrate how a **nominative subject** is still used with a passive verb, even if the subject receives the verb's action.

We will encounter the other major use of the nominative case, the **predicate nominative**, later on.

### Genitive

The **genitive** case at its core indicates some kind of connection between two nouns. A common way to translate the genitive is by using the preposition **"of"** with the genitive noun; we can supply this "of" in translation even though the genitive noun is only one word, and there will not be an explicit word in Latin to render as "of." Also, a genitive usually appears next to or near the noun that it's attached to.

One of the most common connections is **possession**; i.e., we use the genitive case to indicate that one noun possesses or has ownership of another. A **genitive of possession** can thus be translated with the "of" mentioned above or with an appropriate indication of possession in English, **'s** at the end of a noun not ending in -s or simply **'** at the end of a noun already ending in -s.

Take a look at the following examples, with the genitive noun and its translation in bold in each:

* nōmen **puellae**
    * the name **of the girl** *or* the **girl's** name

* aurum **nautārum**
    * the gold **of the sailors** *or* the **sailors'** gold

We will encounter other uses of the genitive later on.
