# Textbook
{: .no_toc }

This is a textbook intended for LATN 1111, Basic Latin, at Fairfield University. **All materials herein are a work in progress**; please feel free to raise any issues (typoes, incorrect information, broken links, etc.) at this site's [Github page](https://github.com/introlatin/introlatin.github.io) or to the author's email: dlibatique [at] fairfield [dot] edu.

This textbook began as a collaboration between myself and Dominic Machado and Neel Smith of the College of the Holy Cross. Their version of the materials can be found at [https://lingualatina.github.io](https://lingualatina.github.io). The grammatical explanations and examples in this textbook are mostly drawn from Holy Cross' [Lingua Latina Legenda](https://lingualatina.github.io/textbook) textbook, with edits made for Fairfield's different progression of topics and with other items added (e.g., homework exercises and an answer key, etc.).

Each module of the textbook contains grammatical notes, exercises for practice, and resources for further exploration of the topic.
