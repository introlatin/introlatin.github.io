## Verb Tenses

We have worked with four out of the six tenses in Latin so far: perfect, imperfect, present, and future. We have two more to discuss in terms of concept and formation: the **pluperfect** and the **future perfect**.

***

## The Pluperfect Tense

### Conceptual Overview

The **pluperfect tense** indicates an action that occurred *prior* to an action in the past. So, we usually translate the pluperfect with the auxiliary verb **"had"**.

- *frātrēs vīdī. eī ex urbe* ***vēnerant***. I saw the brothers. They **had come** out of the city.
- *uxor agricolae laeta erat. carmen eī* ***cecinerat***. The wife of the farmer was happy. He **had sung** a song for her.

These examples hopefully make clear that the pluperfect tense is often used in the context of a past tense like the perfect or imperfect and gives a sense of the circumstances around the action of that past tense verb.

Note the difference between the translation of the **perfect** and the translation of the **pluperfect**. The perfect tense uses **"has" or "have"** as a helping verb; the pluperfect tense uses **"had"** (itself the past tense of "has/have"). This difference in translation indicates two different time periods, so it's important to be accurate!

### Pluperfect Active

To form the **pluperfect active indicative**, we begin by taking the perfect active stem (the third principal part minus the final -ī) and add the pluperfect active endings. They look *exactly* like the imperfect forms of *sum*, *esse*, but are used as endings, attached to a stem to create a one-word form:

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | -eram       | -erāmus      |
| 2nd  | -erās        | -erātis       |
| 3rd  | **-erat**        | **-erant**     |

Thus, a sample paradigm chart of the pluperfect active for a verb like *videō* looks like the following:

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | vīderam       | vīderāmus      |
| 2nd  | vīderās        | vīderātis       |
| 3rd  | **vīderat**        | **vīderant**     |

### Pluperfect Passive

We form the **pluperfect passive indicative** in a manner very similar to that of the perfect passive indicative. We use the 4th principal part as a 2-1-2 adjective that matches the subject in gender, case, and number, and then we conjugate a form of *sum*, *esse* in the appropriate person and number; in this case, with the pluperfect passive, we will use the **imperfect** forms of *sum*.

For instance, for the verb *videō*:

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | vīsus, -a, -um eram       |  vīsī, -ae, -a erāmus    |
| 2nd  | vīsus, -a, -um erās       | vīsī, -ae, -a erātis       |
| 3rd  | **vīsus, -a, -um erat**        | **vīsī, -ae, -a erant**     |

# The Future Perfect Tense

## Conceptual Overview

The **future perfect tense** indicates an action that occurs in the future but *before* an action further in the future. Take a look at this example in English:

- We **will have arrived** before you will wake up. (*The action of our arriving occurs BEFORE the action of your waking up.*)

So, we usually translate the future perfect with the auxiliary verbs **"will have"**. The "will" part conveys the future part of the tense; the "have" part conveys the perfect part of the tense.

## Future Perfect Active

To form the **future perfect active indicative**, we begin by taking the perfect stem (the third principal part minus the final -ī) and add the future perfect active endings. They look almost exactly like the future forms of *sum*, *esse* EXCEPT for the 3rd plural:

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | -erō       | -erimus      |
| 2nd  | -eris        | -eritis       |
| 3rd  | **-erit**        | **-erint**     |

So, if we wanted to form the 3rd person plural future perfect active indicative of *regō*:

*rexī* -> *rex-* (perfect active stem) -> (add personal ending) *rexerint*, "they will have ruled"  

## Future Perfect Passive

We form the **future perfect passive indicative** in a manner very similar to that of the perfect passive indicative. We use the 4th principal part as a 2-1-2 adjective that matches the subject in gender, case, and number, and then we conjugate a form of *sum*, *esse* in the appropriate person and number; in this case, with the future perfect passive, we will use the **future** forms of *sum*. (Note that we use the normal 3rd pl. form, *erunt*, rather than the -i- present in the future perfect active ending.)

For instance, for the verb *moneō*:

| Person      | Singular |Plural |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| 1st   | monitus, -a, -um erō       |  monitī, -ae, -a erimus    |
| 2nd  | monitus, -a, -um eris       | monitī, -ae, -a eritis       |
| 3rd  | **monitus, -a, -um erit**        | **monitī, -ae, -a erunt**     |
