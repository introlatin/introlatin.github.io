## Irregular Verbs

There are a number of **irregular verbs** in Latin, in the sense that their conjugation patterns often do not follow the normal rules or regular patterns that we've been learning for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 3rd -iō, and 4th conjugation verbs. We've encountered two irregular verbs so far (*sum* and *possum*), which we've used in various circumstances like linking sentences and sentences that expect complementary infinitives. In this unit, we introduce 5 more irregular verbs.

- eō, īre, īvī/iī, ītūrus - to go
- ferō, ferre, tūlī, lātus - to bear, carry
- volō, velle, voluī, -- - to want, wish
- nōlō, nolle, noluī, -- - not to want
- mālō, malle, maluī, -- - to prefer

As with *sum* and *possum*, the **perfect system** tenses of these verbs (perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect -- more on the latter two in the next unit) are formed mostly regularly, with some exceptions:
* *volō*, *nōlō*, and *mālō* do not have 4th principal parts and thus do not have perfect passive forms.
* While *eō* does have a 4th principal part, it is not to be used to create perfect passive forms (after all, the verb "to go" is intransitive and does not exist in the passive voice; the sentence "he was goned" or "she has been went" doesn't make sense). The form listed as the 4th principal part is the *future active participle*, with which we will not be dealing this semester.
* Forms of *eō* that begin with a double i followed by an s (for example, the perfect active infinitive **iisse**) can contract the double i into a single long i (e.g., **īsse**).

The tenses that are irregular belong mostly to the **present system**, namely the present, imperfect, and future tenses. While they exhibit some characteristic signs of these tenses that we will recognize (e.g., the imperfect of these verbs will have the **-bā-** sheep syllable), often the verb *stems* will be created irregularly (i.e., not formed from the 2nd principal part minus -re), and some verb forms will even involve multiple words. We'll break down each verb below.

## eō, īre, īvī/iī, ītūrus - to go

This verb's present system tenses use a stem that varies between **e-** and **i-**.

|       | Present Active Indicative | Imperfect Active Indicative | Future Active Indicative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st sg.    | eō | ībam | ībō |
| 2nd sg.   | īs | ībās | ībīs |
| 3rd sg.   | it | ībat | ībit |
| 1st pl.   | īmus | ībāmus | ībīmus |
| 2nd pl.   | ītis | ībātis | ībītis |
| 3rd pl.   | eunt | ībant | ībunt |

In the **present** tense, note how the endings are familiar (e.g., **-t** and **-nt**), but the stems do not follow regular patterns (**it** for 3rd person singular, "he goes", but **eunt** for 3rd person plural, "they go").

In the **imperfect** tense, the familiar endings of **-bā-** sheep syllable plus personal ending are present, but suffixed on a stem of **i-** (e.g., **ībat** for 3rd person singular, "she was going", and **ībant**, "they were going").

The **future** tense uses the same stem of **i-** and uses the future endings of the 1st and 2nd conjugations (e.g., **ībit**, "it will go", and **ībunt**, "they will go").

Be careful about how the forms are spelled, since often one letter will make the difference between tenses (e.g., īb**i**t, "he will go", but īb**a**t, "he was going").

## ferō, ferre, tulī, latus - to bring, bear, carry

This verb's present system generally follows 3rd conjugation patterns, with some omissions of stem vowels in the present tense and a stem of **fer-** in the imperfect and future. Unlike **īre**, "to go", **ferre**, "to bring, bear, carry", is a transitive verb and has both active and passive forms.

(Scroll right within the table for all columns.)

|       | Present Active Indicative | Present Passive Indicative | Imperfect Active Indicative | Imperfect Passive Indicative | Future Active Indicative | Future Passive Indicative | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st sg.    | ferō | feror | ferēbam | ferēbar | feram | ferar |
| 2nd sg.   | fers | ferris | ferēbās | ferēbāris | ferēs | ferēris |
| 3rd sg.   | fert | fertur | ferēbat | ferēbātur | feret | ferētur |
| 1st pl.   | ferimus | ferimur | ferēbāmus | ferēbāmur | ferēmus | ferēmur |
| 2nd pl.   | fertis | feriminī | ferēbātis | ferēbāminī | ferētis | ferēminī |
| 3rd pl.   | ferunt | feruntur | ferēbant | ferēbantur | ferent | ferentur |

In the **present** tense, note that the stem vowel is omitted in the 2nd sg., 3rd sg. (**fert**, "she brings"; **fertur**, "it is carried"), and 2nd pl., but it has a **-u-** as in the 3rd conjugation in the 3rd pl. (**ferunt**, "they bear"; **feruntur**, "they are carried").

The **imperfect** tense is formed on the stem **fer-** with the **-ē-** of the 3rd conjugation coming before the sheep syllable and personal ending (e.g., **ferēbat**, "he was bringing"; **ferēbātur**, "he was being carried"; **ferēbant**, "they were carrying"; **ferēbantur**, "they were being brought").

The **future** tense uses the future endings of the 3rd, 3rd -iō, and 4th conjugations on the stem of **fer-** (**feret**, "she will bring"; **ferētur**, "he will be brought"; **ferent**, "they will bring"; **ferentur**, "they will be brought").

## volō, nōlō, mālō

These three verbs are often explained together given their relationships in meaning and in conjugation (with the forms of *nōlō* and *mālō* generally patterned after those of *volō*).

- volō, velle, voluī, -- - to want, to be willing (+ complementary infinitive)
- nōlō, nolle, noluī, -- - not to want, not to be willing (+ complementary infinitive)
- mālō, malle, maluī, -- - to prefer (+ complementary infinitive)

In the **present** tense, the stems of each of the verbs are truly irregular and sometimes involve multiple words; note, for example, how the 3rd sg. of nōlō, **nōn vult**, "she does not want", is literally a negation (**nōn**, "not") of the 3rd sg. of volō (**vult**, "you want").

|       | volō | nōlō | mālō |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st sg.    | volō | nōlō | mālō |
| 2nd sg.   | vīs | nōn vīs | māvīs |
| 3rd sg.   | vult | nōn vult | māvult |
| 1st pl.   | volumus | nōlumus | mālumus |
| 2nd pl.   | vultis | nōn vultis | māvultis |
| 3rd pl.   | volunt | nōlunt | mālunt |

The **imperfect** and **future** tenses of all three verbs are formed along 3rd conjugation patterns, on stems specific to each verb (volō -> **vol-**; nōlō -> **nōl-**; mālō -> **māl-**).

|       | volō - Impf. Act. Ind. | volō - Fut. Act. Ind. | nōlō - Impf. Act. Ind. | nōlō - Fut. Act. Ind. | mālō - Impf. Act. Ind. | mālō - Fut. Act. Ind. |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st sg.    | volēbam | volam | nōlēbam | nōlam | mālēbam | mālam |
| 2nd sg.   | volēbās | volēs | nōlēbās | nōlēs | mālēbās | mālēs |
| 3rd sg.   | volēbat | volet | nōlēbat | nōlet | mālēbat | mālet |
| 1st pl.   | volēbāmus | volēmus | nōlēbāmus | nōlēmus | mālēbāmus | mālēmus |
| 2nd pl.   | volēbātis | volētis | nōlēbātis | nōlētis | mālēbātis | mālētis |
| 3rd pl.   | volēbant | volent | nōlēbant | nōlent | mālēbant | mālent |

All three verbs generally expect a **complementary infinitive** to fill out their meanings. For example:

* puer vidēre sorōrēs vult.
    * The boy wants to see his sisters.

* dux mīlitēs in urbem mittere nōlet.
    * The leader will not be willing to send the soldiers into the city.

* esse quam videri bonus mālēbat. (Sallust *Catiline* 54.5).
    * He was preferring to be (good) (rather) than to seem good.

In the last example, note that the conjunction **quam** is used with the verb *mālō* to compare two actions, one of which is preferable to the other. When used with a form of *mālō*, it means "(rather) than"; in other contexts, however, it can be the feminine accusative singular of the **relative pronoun**. The presence or absence of a clear antecedent (i.e., a feminine singular noun in the main clause) will be another way to tell the difference between the conjunction **quam** meaning "than" and the relative pronoun **quam** meaning "whom", "which", or "that":

* arbor **quam** puer vīdit magna est.
    * The tree **which** the boy saw is big.
