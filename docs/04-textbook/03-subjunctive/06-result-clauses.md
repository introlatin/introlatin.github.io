## Expressions of Result

In English, an expression of result tells us the **outcome or result** of the action of the main verb. Below are some basic examples and variations of expressions of result (the expression of result is bolded):

- She was so smart **that even her teachers were awed by her intelligence**.
- He worked so hard **that he never slept.**
- She helped them with their homework in such a way **that they got a good grade in the course**.

Notice that the first two examples include the signal adverb **"so"**. Words like "so", "so much", "such", and "such great" often indicate the presence of a result clause in a sentence.

## Result Clauses

The most common way to express result in Latin is through a **result clause**. Result clauses are dependent clauses (i.e., they generally follow an main clause) that have two key features:

- A subordinating conjunction (**ut** for a positive result clause, but **ut ... nōn** for a negative result clause)
  - Note how this differs from a negative purpose clause, which is introduced with **nē**.
- A verb in the subjunctive mood, depending on the sequence of tenses

In addition to these key features, a result clause will be sometimes be preceded by a main clause that features an adverb of degree such as *tam* ("so, such [a]"); *ita* ("so, such [a]"); *sīc* ("thus", "in such a way"); or *adeō* ("to such an extent"); or an adjective of degree like *tantus, -a, -um* ("such great, so much") or *tālis, -e* ("such [a]").

How do we translate a sentence containing a result clause? Take the following example:

- taurus sīc cucurrit ut agricolae eum capere nōn possent.

First, we break the sentence into dependent (bolded) and independent (italicized) clauses. In the case of a sentence containing a result clause, we can recognize the dependent clause rather easily as it begins with **ut** or **ut nōn**.

- *taurus sīc cucurrit* **ut agricolae eum capere nōn possent**.

We then translate the independent clause (notice the use of **sīc** in the independent clause):

- The bull ran *in such a way* **ut agricolae eum capere nōn possent**.

After that, we translate the result clause starting with the conjunction **ut**, "that". The tense of the verb in the result clause translation depends on whether you're in primary or secondary sequence. Take a look at the example from above:

- *taurus sīc cucurrit* **ut agricolae eum capere nōn possent**.
- The bull ran in such a way that the farmers **were not able** to seize it.

In primary sequence, the sentence and translation might look something like this:

- *taurus sīc currit* **ut agricolae eum capere nōn possint**. 
- The bull is running in such a way that the farmers **are not able** to seize it.

Unlike the verbs in purpose clauses, which are translated with auxiliary verbs like "would" or "might", the verbs in result clauses are translated in a more "indicative" way that takes into account the tense of the subjunctive verb in relation to the tense of the main verb.
