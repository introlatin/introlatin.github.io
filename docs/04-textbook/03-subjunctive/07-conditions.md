## Conditions - Overview

**Conditional clauses** are dependent clauses that indicate what happens **if** something else occurs. The action of the main verb happens if the condition stated in the dependent clause is fulfilled. We might also refer to them as "conditions" or "conditionals".

Conditions are composed of two clauses:
- a dependent **protasis** (the "if" clause)
- the main **apodosis** (the "[then]" clause)

For example:

If we study for the exam, we will get good grades.

"If we study for the exam" is the **protasis**, while "we will get good grades" is the **apodosis**. The apodosis explains what happens as a result of the condition in the protasis being met.

Protases are usually introduced by the subordinating conjunction **sī**, "if", or **nisī**, "if ... not" or "unless".

## Conditions Chart

The following chart indicates the six types of conditions that are in Latin. This is meant as a summary and a convenient study aid that collects all the possibilities in one place, with the remaining sections in this unit explaining each.

| **Condition Type** | **Protasis ("if") Tense and Mood** | **Apodosis ("then") Tense and Mood** | **Translation** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **past simple** | past indicative | past indicative | -- |
| **present simple** | present indicative | present indicative | -- |
| **future more vivid** | future or future perfect | future or future perfect | [protasis can optionally be translated as present] |
| **past contrary-to-fact** | pluperfect subjunctive | pluperfect subjunctive | "had ... would have" |
| **present contrary-to-fact** | imperfect subjunctive | imperfect subjunctive | "were ... would" |
| **future less vivid** | present subjunctive | present subjunctive | "should ... would" |

We can broadly split these six condition types into two categories: **indicative conditions**, so called because the verbs used in each clause are in the indicative mood, and **subjunctive conditions**, so called because the verbs used in each clause are in the subjunctive mood.

To illustrate the differences, we will use the same base sentence to illustrate how each of the different conditions works:

"If he does it, he is wise."

## Indicative Conditions

Conditions that use the indicative mood in both clauses express general truths; for that reason, they are often called **general conditions**. We can always translate an indicative verb at face value depending on its tense: for example, if you see an imperfect tense indicative verb, translate it as a straightforward imperfect. There will also be further options for translation when it comes to the future more vivid.

There are three specific types of conditions that use the indicative in both clauses:

### Past Simple

A **past simple** condition uses **past tenses in the indicative** in both the protasis and apodosis and explains a general truth about an action in the past. The use of the indicative indicates that the speaker is reasonably certain that the actions in question were actually performed.

- *sī id fēcit, sapiēns erat.* If he did it, he was wise.
- *sī id faciēbat, sapiēns erat.* If he was doing it, he was wise.
- *sī id fēcerat, sapiēns erat.* If he had done it, he was wise.

### Present Simple

A **present simple** condition uses the **present tense in the indicative** in both clauses to explain a general truth in the present. The use of the indicative indicates that the speaker is reasonably certain that the actions in question are actually happening.

- *sī id facit, sapiēns est.* If he does / is doing it, he is wise.

### Future More Vivid / Future Simple

The **future more vivid** or **future simple** condition uses either the **future** or the **future perfect** tense in both clauses to indicate a general truth in the future. The use of the indicative indicates that the speaker is reasonably certain that the actions in question will actually happen.

- *sī id faciet, sapiēns erit.* If he will do it, he will be wise.
- *sī id fēcerit, sapiēns erit.* If he will have done it, he will be wise.

Note that due to the idiosyncrasies of English, with the **future more vivid**, you have the option of translating the verb in the protasis, whether it's future or future perfect, as a **present** tense:

- *sī id faciet, sapiēns erit.* If he does (literally "will do") this, he will be wise.
- *sī id fēcerit, sapiēns erit.* If he does (literally "will have done") this, he will be wise.

In this case, using a present tense to translate the apodosis contributes to the generalizing quality of the condition; it also sounds better in English, especially if the verb in your protasis is in the future perfect, the translation of which usually sounds stilted and odd in modern English.

## Subjunctive Conditions

Two conditions that use the subjunctive indicate actions that would have happened upon the enactment of some condition; however, that condition was not met, so the entire condition is just a thought experiment that is contrary to what factually happened or is happening. A third condition that uses the subjunctive indicates an action that may occur in the future contingent upon the completion of a condition, but it's uncertain whether it will happen.

### Past Contrary-to-Fact

A **past contrary-to-fact** (or **past contrafactual**) condition indicates what **would have** happened **if** something **had** happened. Both clauses will use the **pluperfect subjunctive**.

The protasis will translate the pluperfect subjunctive straightforwardly: **"had [verb]ed"**.

The apodosis will translate the pluperfect subjunctive with the auxiliariy verbs **"would have [verb]ed."**

- *sī id fēcisset, sapiēns fuisset.* If he had done it, he would have been wise.

Note that the subjunctive mood indicates the irreality of this condition. If he had done it, he would have been wise: but he didn't do it, and therefore he wasn't wise. The condition is **contrary to fact** because it didn't happen.

### Present Contrary-to-Fact

A **present contrary-to-fact** (or **present contrafactual**) condition indicates what **would** happen **if** something **were** happening. Both clauses will use the **imperfect subjunctive**.

The protasis will translate the imperfect subjunctive with the auxiliary verb **"were [verb]ing."**

The apodosis will translate the imperfect subjunctive with the auxiliary verb **"would [verb]."**

- *sī id faceret, sapiēns esset.* If he were doing it, he would be wise.

The same contrary-to-fact-ness applies to this condition, but in present time. If he *were* doing it *right now*, he would be wise *at the present time* -- but he isn't doing it, and so he's not wise.

### Future Less Vivid

The **future less vivid** condition indicates an action that **would** happen in the future, if another action **should** happen first. Both clauses will use the **present subjunctive**.

The protasis will translate the present subjunctive with the auxiliary **"should [verb]."**

The apodosis will translate the present subjunctive with the auxiliary **"would [verb]."**

- *sī id faciat, sapiēns sit.* If he should do it, he would be wise.

Note that the translation of the apodosis is the same as the apodosis of a present contrary-to-fact; the difference lies in the time when the action of the protasis would be completed: in the present for a present contrary-to-fact; in the future for a future less vivid.

Rarely, you may see a perfect subjunctive instead of a present subjunctive in the protasis:

- sī id fēcerit, sapiēns sit. If he should do it, he would be wise.

Be careful not to mix up the **future less vivid**, a subjunctive condition that uses the present subjunctive, with the **future more vivid**, an indicative condition that uses the future or future perfect indicative. The **future** ***more*** **vivid** is "more vivid" because of the indicative mood, indicating that it's likely to happen; the **future** ***less*** **vivid** is "less vivid" because the subjunctive mood introduces a note of doubt.

## Summary

Conditions require careful attention not only to the tenses and moods of individual verbs in each clause but also to the construction of the sentence that contains them. If, for example, you misidentify the apodosis of a past contrary-to-fact condition as its protasis, you might attribute the wrong helping verbs to each verb, e.g. "had" instead of "would have" and vice versa; such a mix-up would fundamentally change the meaning of the sentence.
