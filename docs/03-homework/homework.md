## Homework 3 (Due W 2/1)

{: .no_toc }

Each of the following prompts gives you the nominative singular of a noun in the [Week 3 Vocabulary](../vocabulary/week-03-vocabulary). Use the Week 3 Vocabulary to decline the noun into the requested case and number. For example:

puer, genitive plural  
**puerōrum**

1. caput, accusative plural
2. nauta, dative singular
3. taurus, nominative plural
4. rex, genitive plural
5. via, ablative plural

### Part 2
{: .no_toc }

Use the [Week 3 Vocabulary](../vocabulary/week-03-vocabulary) again to indicate the **gender, case, and number** of the given noun form. In cases of ambiguity, give just one possible answer (you do not need to state them all). For example:

puellās  
**feminine accusative plural**

1. viā
2. nōmen
3. filiōs
4. arborī
5. agricolārum

## Homework 4 (Due R 2/2)

Use the [Week 3 Vocabulary](../vocabulary/week-03-vocabulary) and the [Week 3 paradigms](../paradigms/week-03-paradigms) to identify the **case and use** of the bolded noun in each of the following sentences. Then **translate the sentence** (for which you will likely also need the [Week 2 Vocabulary](../vocabulary/week-02-vocabulary)). For example:

puer **taurum** vīdit.  
- **taurum** = accusative, direct object. "The boy saw the bull."

1. puella **equō** nōmen dedit.
2. rex aurum **nautārum** habuit.
3. puerī **librōs** cēpērunt.
