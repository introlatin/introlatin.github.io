# Answer Key
{: .no_toc }

This is an answer key for all the homework assignments. I encourage you to complete the homework assignments first without this key, submit those answers to Blackboard, and then use this answer key to check your work. While I can't stop you from just submitting these answers verbatim, please know that it's in your best interest to practice with the concepts and vocabulary, rather than taking an easy shortcut, especially when it comes to internalizing information for in-class check-ins!

## Practice Homework 1 (Due R 1/19)

1. When are my (Prof. Libatique's) student hours, and where are they held? (See the Course Info and Policies pages).  
**Monday 10:30-11:30am, Wednesday 10am-11am, or by appointment, in Donnarumma 124.**

2. What defines an "unexcused absence"? (See Policies.)  
**An absence from class after which you have not communicated with me (Prof. Libatique) about it up to 24 hours after the absence, except in cases of emergency**

3. How many semester points do you have to accumulate to earn an A for the semester? (See Grading.)  
**950.**

4. True or false: you are allowed to use Google Translate to complete your assignments. (See Grading.)  
**False!** (I'm looking to see you working through the process of figuring out how a Latin sentence works; not only does using Google Translate mean that you're not fulfilling that course objective, but also Google Translate is often wrong in terms of vocabulary and syntax!)

5. True or false: you can find the answers to all homework assignments on this website. (Hint: see [Answer Key](answer-key)).  
**True!** (The homework assignments are much more about getting practice with the concepts [and they are only graded on completeness, not correctness], so it's in your best interest to complete the homework assignments using your notes, slideshows, and brains first and then check your work against the answer key, rather than just copying and pasting the answers.)

**conjugation**

4. What is the term for the act of changing the endings of nouns to reflect a noun's different cases and numbers?  
**declension**

5. True or false: we use word order in Latin to determine the functions of words.

***

## Homework 4 (Due R 2/2)

1. **puella** dormīvit.  
**puella** = nominative, subject. "The girl slept."

2. dux **nautārum** cucurrit.  
**nautārum** = genitive, possession. "The leader of the sailors ran" or "The sailors' leader ran."

3. **puerī** vēnērunt.  
**puerī** = nominative, subject. "The boys came."

4. **arbōrēs** agricolae stetērunt.  
**arbōrēs** = nominative, subject. "The trees of the farmer stood" or "The farmer's trees stood."
* **Note**: **agricolae** is translated as a genitive of possession above. It technically can also be nominative plural and thus a subject. However, in tomorrow's class, we'll learn about how the definition of **stetērunt** ("to stand") rules out **arbōrēs** being accusative plural, and since its only other possibility is nominative plural, it's more reasonable to take **arbōrēs** as our subject and **agricolae** as a genitive of possession.

5. fīlius **virī** fūgit.  
**virī** = genitive, possession. "The son of the man ran" or "The man's son ran."
* **Note**: **virī** can also be nominative plural, but we can rule out that possibility due to the **singular** number of the verb, and remember, a subject and verb have to agree in number.

***

## Homework 5 (Due M 2/6)

1. nautae **aquam** cēpērunt.  
**aquam** = accusative, direct object. "The sailors took the water."

2. mater et pater cībum **fīliīs** dedit.  
**fīliīs** = dative, indirect object. "The mother and father gave food to the sons/daughters" or "The mother and father gave the sons/daughters food." 
* (Note: **fīliīs** can come either from **fīlius, fīliī, m. - son** or **fīlia, fīliae, f. - daughter**!)

3. puer templum **deōrum** vīdit.  
**deōrum** = genitive, possession. "The boy saw the temple of the gods" or "The boy saw the gods' temple."

4. vir **aurum** mīsit.  
**aurum** = accusative, direct object. "The man sent the gold." 
* (Note: While **aurum** can be either nominative or accusative singular [because it's a neuter noun], **vir** can only be a nominative subject, and with an active, transitive verb like **mīsit**, it makes more sense to consider **aurum** an accusative direct object.)

5. **puellae** equōs agricolārum dūxērunt.  
**puellae** = nominative, subject. "The girls led the farmers' horses" or "The girls led the horses of the farmers."
* (Note: **puellae** can be genitive singular, dative singular, or nominative plural. The genitive option would be hard to reconcile with the other unambiguously genitive noun ["They led the horses of the girl of the farmers"??], and while the dative is technically possible ["They led the horses of the farmers *for the girl*"], it seems more straightforward to take **puellae** as a nominative subject.)
