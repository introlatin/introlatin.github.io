# Answer Key
{: .no_toc }

This is an answer key for all the homework assignments. I encourage you to complete the homework assignments first without this key, submit those answers to Blackboard, and then use this answer key to check your work. While I can't stop you from just submitting these answers verbatim, please know that it's in your best interest to practice with the concepts and vocabulary, rather than taking an easy shortcut, especially when it comes to internalizing information for in-class check-ins!

## Practice Homework 1 (Due R 1/18)

1. When are my (Prof. Libatique's) student hours, and where are they held? (See the Course Info and Policies pages).  
**Tuesday 9-11am via Zoom (and you need to sign up beforehand using the link on Blackboard); Wednesday 11am-12pm in person (in Donnarumma 124) or by appointment.**

2. What defines an "unexcused absence"? (See Policies.)  
**An absence from class after which you have not communicated with me (Prof. Libatique) about it up to 24 hours after the absence, except in cases of emergency**

3. How many semester points do you have to accumulate to earn an A for the semester? (See Grading.)  
**950.**

4. True or false: you are allowed to use Google Translate to complete your assignments. (See Grading.)  
**False!** (I'm looking to see you working through the process of figuring out how a Latin sentence works; not only does using Google Translate mean that you're not fulfilling that course objective, but also Google Translate is often wrong in terms of vocabulary and syntax!)

5. True or false: you can find the answers to all homework assignments on this website. (Hint: see [Answer Key](answer-key)).  
**True!** (The homework assignments are much more about getting practice with the concepts [and they are only graded on completeness, not correctness], so it's in your best interest to complete the homework assignments using your notes, slideshows, and brains first and then check your work against the answer key, rather than just copying and pasting the answers.)

**conjugation**

4. What is the term for the act of changing the endings of nouns to reflect a noun's different cases and numbers?  
**declension**

5. True or false: we use word order in Latin to determine the functions of words.

**nautae**

3. taurus, nominative plural  
**taurī**

5. agricolārum  
**masculine genitive plural**

***

## Homework 5 (Due R 2/1)

1. **puella** dormīvit.  
**puella** = nominative, subject. "The girl slept."

2. dux **nautārum** cucurrit.  
**nautārum** = genitive, possession. "The leader of the sailors ran" or "The sailors' leader ran."

3. **puerī** vēnērunt.  
**puerī** = nominative, subject. "The boys came."

4. **arbōrēs** agricolae stetērunt.  
**arbōrēs** = nominative, subject. "The trees of the farmer stood" or "The farmer's trees stood."
* **Note**: **agricolae** is translated as a genitive of possession above. It technically can also be nominative plural and thus a subject. However, in tomorrow's class, we'll learn about how the definition of **stetērunt** ("to stand") rules out **arbōrēs** being accusative plural, and since its only other possibility is nominative plural, it's more reasonable to take **arbōrēs** as our subject and **agricolae** as a genitive of possession.

5. fīlius **virī** fūgit.  
**virī** = genitive, possession. "The son of the man ran" or "The man's son ran."
* **Note**: **virī** can also be nominative plural, but we can rule out that possibility due to the **singular** number of the verb, and remember, a subject and verb have to agree in number.

***

## Homework 6 (Due M 2/5)

1. nautae **aquam** cēpērunt.  
**aquam** = accusative, direct object. "The sailors took the water."

2. mater et pater cībum **fīliīs** dedit.  
**fīliīs** = dative, indirect object. "The mother and father gave food to the sons/daughters" or "The mother and father gave the sons/daughters food." 
* (Note: **fīliīs** can come either from **fīlius, fīliī, m. - son** or **fīlia, fīliae, f. - daughter**!)

3. puer templum **deōrum** vīdit.  
**deōrum** = genitive, possession. "The boy saw the temple of the gods" or "The boy saw the gods' temple."

4. vir **aurum** mīsit.  
**aurum** = accusative, direct object. "The man sent the gold." 
* (Note: While **aurum** can be either nominative or accusative singular [because it's a neuter noun], **vir** can only be a nominative subject, and with an active, transitive verb like **mīsit**, it makes more sense to consider **aurum** an accusative direct object.)

5. **puellae** equōs agricolārum dūxērunt.  
**puellae** = nominative, subject. "The girls led the farmers' horses" or "The girls led the horses of the farmers."
* (Note: **puellae** can be genitive singular, dative singular, or nominative plural. The genitive option would be hard to reconcile with the other unambiguously genitive noun ["They led the horses of the girl of the farmers"??], and while the dative is technically possible ["They led the horses of the farmers *for the girl*"], it seems more straightforward to take **puellae** as a nominative subject.)

## Homework 12 (Due T 2/20)

1. equī ex agrīs cucurrērunt.  
**The horses ran out of the fields.** [ablative of place from which / motion away from]

2. equī ūnām hōram cucurrērunt.  
**The horses ran for one hour.** [accusative of extent of time]

3. equī ad agrōs cucurrērunt.  
**The horses ran towards the fields.** [accusative of place to which / motion toward]

4. vir malum ducem prīmīs mensibus interfēcit.  
**The man killed the bad leader within the first months.** [ablative of time within which]

    * Note: While **prīmīs mensibus** can technically be an ablative of time when, keep in mind that the ablative of time when pinpoints a *specific* point in time at which the verbal action occurs. With a plural time word like **mensibus** and the length of time that it indicates, it makes more sense to take it here as an ablative of time within which.

5. vir malum ducem prō templō interfēcit.  
**The man killed the bad leader in front of the temple.** [ablative of place in which / place where]

6. vir malum ducem ultimā hōrā interfēcit.  
**The man killed the bad leader within the last hour.** [if **ultimā hōrā** is ablative of time within which]; ***or*** **The man killed the bad leader at the last hour.** [if **ultimā hōrā** is ablative of time when]

    * Note: While "hour" can indicate a range of time [and thus ablative of time within which is a legitimate interpretation], if you zoom out your timeline, you can consider an hour basically just one point on a timeline that spans months or years; thus, ablative of time when is also a legitimate interpretation, emphasizing that this was one action at one point in a long timeline.

***

## Homework 13 (Due W 2/21)

### Part 1
{: .no_toc }

1. capiō -> taurus __________.  
taurus **captus est**. "The bull was taken" or "The bull has been taken."

2. videō -> corpus __________.   
corpus **vīsum est**. "The body was seen" or "The bull has been seen."

    * Note: The passive voice here can technically yield translations like "The body *seemed*" or "The body *has seemed*." The nature of a linking verb like "seem", however, often expects a predicate nominative, while a passive verb like "was seen" can complete a thought in and of itself. The lack of a predicate nominative (e.g., "The body seemed *large*") makes "seemed" a less attractive option in terms of translation.
    * Note 2: Don't be fooled by the -us ending on **corpus**: its dictionary entry is **corpus, corporis, n. - "body"**, meaning that it's a neuter noun.

3. audiō -> verba __________.  
verba **audīta sunt**. "The words were heard" or "The words have been heard."

    * Note: Again, be aware of the gender of your noun -- the -a ending on **verbum, verbī, n. - "word"**, a 2nd declension *neuter* noun, means not only that your participle must be **neuter plural** but also that your form of **esse** has to be **3rd plural**.

4. relinquō -> via __________.  
via **relicta est**. "The road was left" or "The road has been left."

    * Note: This noun, on the other hand, is a first declension noun (**via, viae, f. - "road"**), making the subject (and thus your participle) **feminine singular** and your form of **esse** **3rd singular**.

5. interficere -> ducēs __________.  
ducēs **interfectī sunt**. "The leaders were killed" or "The leaders have been killed."

### Part 2
{: .no_toc }

1. dōna fīliīs ā patre data sunt.  
subject = **dōna**; verb = **data sunt**  
**The gifts were given to the sons/daughters by the father.**

2. fīlius ob cībum laetus factus est.  
subject = **fīlius**; verb = **factus est**  
**The son became happy because of the food.**

3. equī ex agrīs ab agricolā ductī sunt.  
subject = **equī**; verb = **ductī sunt**  
**The horses were led out of the fields by the farmer.**

4. dux nautārum fortis vīsus est.  
subject = **dux**; verb = **vīsus est**  
**The leader of the sailors seemed brave.**

5. monstrum ultimā hōrā captum est.  
subject = **monstrum**; verb = **captum est**  
**The monster was caught in/at the last hour.**
