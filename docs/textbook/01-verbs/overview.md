## Verbs - Definition

Ancient Greek, like English, has several **parts of speech** into which words can be classified. The first part of speech under consideration is the **verb**, defined here as a word that indicates **action** or a **state of being**. Take a look at the following examples in English:

* The defendant **showed** the evidence.
* You **had** my attention.
* The story **was** very long.
* The victims **were wronged**.

In each of these sentences, the verb is bolded and serves as the anchor of the entire sentence, communicating the idea that the sentence is trying to convey. Note that the verb can indicate **action** ("showed", "had", "were wronged") or a **static state** ("was"). We'll learn more about these distinctions as the module continues.

***

## Verb Aspects

Verbs can appear in different forms, including **infinitives** (verbal nouns, like "to make" or "to do") or **participles** (verbal adjectives, like "making" or "done"). For this module, however, we'll be focusing mostly on verbs that are **conjugated** (more on this in a bit).

As discussed in [the page on inflection](../basics/inflection#conjugation), we can change the endings of verbs to reflect different aspects of the verb through a process called **conjugation**. A conjugated verb, then, exhibits five major **aspects** that we can glean through **the verb's ending** and **the verb stem** to which that ending is attached. Through this combination of stem and ending, we can figure out such aspects of a verb as who performs the verb's action and how many of the actor there are.

The following is a broad overview of verbal aspects that we can identify through a verb's stem and ending. We will reinforce these ideas as the year continues, so do not worry if you're overwhelmed by all of these ideas now.

1. **person**. The **person** of a verb indicates the relationship of the speaker of the sentence to the subject.
    * **1st person** means that the speaker *is* the subject or is part of a group that serves as the subject. This is most often indicated through pronouns like "I" or "me" in the singular or "we" or "us" in the plural.
    * **2nd person** means that the speaker is *addressing* the subject. This is most often indicated through pronouns like "you" (singular or plural) or "you all / y'all" (only plural).
    * **3rd person** means that the speaker is talking about someone that is neither the speaker nor the addressee. This is often indicated through pronouns like "he, she, it, they" as subjects or "him, her, it, them" as objects. Also, a third-person subject can be explicitly named. For example, "**The bees** make honey" or "**The sky** is blue" -- both "the bees" and "the sky" are examples of third-person subjects.

2. **number**. The **number** of a verb indicates how many of the subject there are.
    * **singular** indicates that there is just one of the subject.
    * **plural** indicates that there are more than one of the subject.
    * **dual** indicates that there are exactly two of the subject. (The dual is relatively rare, but it tends to be used with subjects that are natural pairs like eyes or knees in early Greek works like the *Iliad* or the *Odyssey*.)
<br><br>
3. **tense**. The **tense** of a verb indicates *when* the action of the verb occurs. Focus for now on the first four, as the final three (perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect) are relatively rare, especially in comparison to the first four.
    * **aorist** tense indicates that the action of the verb happened instantaneously, at one single point, in the past.
    * **imperfect** tense indicates that the action of the verb occurred continuously, over a period of time, in the past. Note the difference between the **aorist** and the **imperfect**; the former is a single point, like a photograph, while the latter takes place over a period of time, like a video.
    * **present** tense indicates that the action of the verb is happening *now*.
    * **future** tense indicates that the action of the verb will occur later but hasn't happened yet.
    * **perfect** tense indicates that the action of the verb occurred in the past with lasting effects into the present. For example, "he *has died*" -- he died at a point in the past, but he is still dead today.
    * **pluperfect** tense indicates that the action of the verb occurred *before* another event in the past but had lasting effects into that past moment. For example, "he *had died* before the war ended" -- his death came before the war ended, and he was still dead when the war did end.
    * **future perfect** tense indicates that the action of the verb will have occurred *before* another event in the future but will have lasting effects into that future moment. For example, "he *will have died* before the war will end" -- his death will come before the war's end, and it will last into that future moment.
<br><br>
4. **voice**. The **voice** of a verb indicates the relationship of the subject to the action of the verb.
  * The verb's voice is **active** if the subject *performs* the action of the verb. For example, "The boy **loves** the girl." The boy performs the action of loving.
  * The verb's voice is **passive** if the subject *receives* the action of the verb. For example, "The girl **is loved** by the boy." The girl *receives* the action of loving, even though she is the subject, so the verb is considered passive.
  * The verb's voice is **middle** if the subject either performs the verb's action with some self-interested motive or performs the action upon themself. It's often difficult to express the middle voice in English, but often some form of a reflexive pronoun (e.g., "myself", "himself", "ourselves") can help. For example, "He *speaks (for himself)*" or "We *know ourselves*."
<br><br>
5. **mood**. The **mood** of a verb indicates how the speaker thinks about the quality of the verb's action.
  * **indicative** mood indicates that the speaker considers the verb's action a definite fact.
  * **imperative** mood indicates that the speaker considers the verb's action a command.
  * **subjunctive** mood indicates that the speaker considers the verb's action as less definite, a possibility rather than an established fact.
  * **optative** mood indicates that the speaker considers the verb's action a wish or even less definite than the subjunctive.


These five aspects apply mainly to **conjugated verbs**, here defined as verbs with a **person** and a **number**. We may also refer to **conjugated verbs** as **finite verbs**, since we limit (or make finite) the verb by giving it a subject with a person and a number. Other verbal forms exhibit only some of the aspects (e.g., infinitives and participles both have tense and voice but not person, number, or mood); we will deal with those in later lessons.

So, in sum, a **finite verb** has some combination of the following five aspects:

1. **person**: 1st, 2nd, 3rd
2. **number**: singular, plural, dual
3. **tense**: aorist, imperfect, present, future, perfect, pluperfect, future perfect
4. **voice**: active, passive, middle
5. **mood**: indicative, imperative, subjunctive, optative

The act of identifying the five aspects of a conjugated verb is called **parsing**. So, if I were asked to parse the verb ἐκέλευσαν, I would answer: 3rd plural aorist active indicative. (We'll learn much more about parsing and identification in the coming modules.)

***

### Practice Opportunity

In each of the following English sentences, identify the finite/conjugated verb and then parse all aspects *except* mood according to the details above. For example:

* I went to the store.
    * "went", 1st singular aorist active
* You (pl.) were going to bed.
    * "were going", 2nd plural imperfect active

[Answer key here](../answer-key#verbs-overview-po1).

1. He will arrive tomorrow.
2. You (singular) ordered French fries.
3. You (sg.) ordered French fries for yourself.
4. We are reading the books.
5. The documents were being shown to me.

## Dictionary Entry

When you are learning verbs in ancient Greek, you must memorize the way that the verb's entry appears in a dictionary, such as the [master vocabulary list](../../vocabulary/master) for this very textbook. You'll notice that entries for verbs have seven sections: the first six, in Greek, are called **principal parts** and the seventh, in English, is the definition of the verb.

Here are two examples:

* κελεύω, κελεύσω, ἐκέλευσα, κεκέλευκα, κεκέλευσμαι, ἐκελεύσθην, "[to order](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n56496)"  
* δείκνυμι, δείξω, ἔδειξα, δέδειχα, δέδειγμα, ἐδείχθην, "[to show](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n23658)"

Each of the **principal parts** gives you the stem for the verb's forms in certain tenses and voices. Here's an overview:

| Principal Part | Form of Verb | What You Can Conjugate With It |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1st | 1st sg. present | present and imperfect tense forms in all voices |
| 2nd | 1st sg. future | future active and middle forms |
| 3rd | 1st sg. aorist | aorist active and middle forms |
| 4th | 1st sg. perfect active | perfect, plupf., and fut. pf. active forms |
| 5th | 1st sg. perfect middle/passive | perfect, plupf., and fut. pf. middle/passive forms |
| 6th | 1st sg. aorist passive | aorist passive and future passive forms |

Not all verbs have all six principal parts. In such cases, there will be a -- in the places where the verb does not have a principal part. For example:

* δοκέω, δόξω, ἔδοξα, --, δέδογμαι, -ἐδόχθην, "[to think](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n56496)"

### Conjugation

The dictionary entry of a verb also indicates a group to which it belongs that dictates what kind of endings we can use to conjugate the verb in question. Confusingly, these groups are called **conjugations**, and there are two major conjugations of Greek verbs:

* **ω** verbs are those with a first principal part that ends in either -ω or -ομαι.
* **μι** verbs are those with a first principal part that ends in either -μι or -μαι (with no omicron before it).

There are further finer distinctions that we will draw as the year wears on, but this is the general rule.

***

## Compounds

Many verbs in Greek may be prefixed with a preposition to form new verbs. For example, we can combine δείκνυμι, "to show", with the preposition ἐπί, "to" or "toward", to form the verb ἐπιδείκνυμι:

* ἐπιδείκνυμι, ἐπιδείξω, ἐπέδειξα, ἐπιδέδειχα, ἐπιδέδειγμαι, ἐπεδείχθην, "[to demonstrate, prove](http://folio2.furman.edu/lsj/?urn=urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.chicago_md:n39125)"

Note how we simply attach the ἐπί to the front of the verb, but its ι drops off in forms that begin with a vowel through a process called **elision**. If the final vowel of a prefix is elided by a verb form that begins with a rough breathing, the final consonant of the prefix may be aspirated. For example, if ἐπί were attached to a verb that begins with ἁ, the aspiration of the rough breathing would interact with the π to form ἐφα- (rather than ἐπα-).

***

## Accentuation

Note that the accent on a finite verb form is **recessive**. Recall from the unit [on the alphabet and accents](../basics/alphabet-and-accents#persistence-versus-recession) that this means that the accent on a finite verb form wants to occupy the farthest-left syllable that it can. In 3+ syllable finite verb forms, this means the antepenult (unless pulled to the penult by a long ultima); and in 2 syllable forms, the penult. Note, for example, the following forms of the same verb:

* ἐκέλευσε
* κελεύει

In the first form, the accent (an acute) occupies the antepenult since the ultima, -ε, is short. In the second form, however, the acute accent gets pulled to the penult due to the long ultima, -ει.

Although the accent on finite verb forms is recessive, note that the accents on participles and some infinitives are persistent. More on this later.

## Example Nouns

This entire module will focus on verbs, which, granted, are the most important part of a Greek sentence. However, Greek sentences comprise other parts of speech, like nouns and adjectives, that help make sentences more interesting and less monotonous. Without them, we end up with boring strings of sentences: "I go. He ordered. They were shown."

So, here, we will introduce a very limited set of nouns to make the examples and exercises in this module more interesting. You do not need to memorize these forms right now (though you will memorize them in module 2, and early memorization makes that task easier later on!), and there are a few ideas about nouns to keep in mind:

* Nouns are inflected (i.e., we change the endigns of nouns) to indicate the noun's function in the sentence. This process of inflection is called **declension**, and we **decline** nouns into different **cases** that cover a noun's different functions, also called "uses".
* The two **cases** and accompanying **uses** that the following nouns will demonstrate are:
    * the **nominative case**, used for the **subject** of a verb (in any voice)
    * the **accusative case**, used for the **direct object** of an active or middle voice verb (a **direct object** is a noun that *receives* the action of the verb; for example, "the ball" in "The boy kicks *the ball*.")
* A noun, like a verb, has **number**: singular, plural, or dual.
* The number of a verb's subject must match the number of the verb (i.e., if the verb is singular, the subject must be singular).

Here are the nouns that we will use in the coming chapters. You can bookmark [this link](https://libatique.info/GREK101-F21/textbook/verbs/overview#example-nouns) to refer to this chart whenever you need.

| Definition | Nom. Sg. | Nom. Pl. | Acc. Sg. | Acc. Pl. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| the city | ἡ πόλις | αἱ πόλεις | τὴν πόλιν | τὰς πόλεις |
| the citizen | ὁ πολίτης | οἱ πολῖται | τὸν πολίτην | τοὺς πολίτας |
| the person | ὁ ἄνθρωπος | οἱ ἄνθρωποι | τὸν ἄνθρωπον | τοὺς ἀνθρώπους |
| the thing; (plural) the money | τὸ χρῆμα | τὰ χρήματα | τὸ χρῆμα | τὰ χρήματα |
