## Second Aorist

As discussed in [the unit on first aorists](first-aorist#first-and-second-aorists), a verb's third principal part can be either **first aorist** or **second aorist**, as determined by the principal part's ending: a **first aorist** ends in -α or -άμην, while a **second aorist** ends in -ον or -όμην. Note, for example, the dictionary entries for ἄγω, ἔχω, and λέγω above: their third principal parts each end in -ον, which means that they are **second aorists**.

The distinction between **first aorists** and **second aorists** affects only the formation of the **aorist active and middle**, i.e., the forms created using the **third principal part**. There is no meaningful distinction of first or second aorist in the aorist passive or sixth principal part; the distinction affects only the aorist active and middle. Otherwise, the first and second aorist operate along the same general rules: they indicate an instantaneous or completed event in the past in the active or middle voice.

***

### Formation

The conjugation of the second aorist is very similar to the conjugation of the first aorist, just with different endings.

Here are the steps to conjugate a second aorist:
1. To get the verb stem, take the -ον off the third principal part.  
2. Add the appropriate ending to indicate the appropriate person, number, and voice.  
3. Apply a recessive accent based on the rules laid out [in the unit on accents](../basics/alphabet-and-accents#accents).

#### (2nd) Aorist Active Endings

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | `-ον` | `-ομεν` |
| 2nd | `-ες` | `-ετε`|
| 3rd | **-ε(ν)** | **-ον** |

#### (2nd) Aorist Middle Endings

| Person | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | `-όμην` | `-όμεθα` |
| 2nd | `-ου` | `-εσθε`|
| 3rd | **-ετο** | **-οντο** |

#### Application
{: .no_toc }

Let's practice conjugating the second aorist with the verb ἄγω (third principal part: **ἤγαγον**).

1. When we take off the -ον, we are left with the stem **ἤγαγ-**.
2. We can then apply the appropriate endings:
    * for the active, it's -ε(ν) for the 3rd singular and -ον for the third plural.
    * for the middle, it's -ετο for the 3rd singular and -οντο for the third plural.
3. All accents will be placed on the antepenult since none of the ultimas contained in these endings is long.

These rules result in the following forms:

| Voice | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Active | ἤγαγε(ν) | ἤγαγον |
| Middle | ἠγάγετο | ἠγάγοντο |  

(Again, note that the distinction between first and second aorist affects *only* the third principal part. The aorist passive forms of ἄγω are formed according to the same rules described [in the unit on first aorists](first-aorist#aorist-passive); 3rd sg. is ἤχθη, while 3rd pl. is ἤχθησαν.)

#### Translation
{: .no_toc }

Again, the only difference between a second aorist and a first aorist is the endings used to conjugate it; everything else remains the same. The verbal action is still an instantaneous or completed action in the past, and the voice of the verb indicates the relationship of the subject to the verb's action. So, here are some examples of ways to translate our newly-conjugated forms:

* ἤγαγεν: "he/she/it led"
* ἤγαγον: "they led"
* ἠγάγετο: "he/she/it led (for themself)"
* ἠγάγοντο: "they led (for themselves)"
* [ἤχθη: "he/she/it was led"]
* [ἤχθησαν: "they were led"]

## Deponent Verbs

You will notice that some dictionary entries lack active forms in some or all principal parts and will instead show **middle** forms, as evidenced by the principal parts' endings. Take a look at the dictionary entry above for **γίγνομαι**, "to become, to happen" in particular. We would expect an active ending like -α or -ον in the third principal part, but instead, we get **ἐγενόμην**, with an ending of -όμην (which is 1st person aorist middle indicative, as seen in the FYI endings in the chart above). Notice, though, that the verb's definition sounds active: "to become", "to happen."

Such verbs that lack active forms in some or all principal parts are known as **deponent verbs**. While deponent verbs are conjugated in the middle or passive voice, the main thing to keep in mind is that deponent verbs are **middle or passive in form, but active in meaning**. So, while forms like ἐγένετο or ἐγενήθη are middle or passive respectively, one cannot "be becomed" or "be happened", so an active translation like "he became" or "they became" is needed.

To conjugate deponents, the steps are the same: get the stem, add the appropriate ending, apply an accent. In these cases, the stem can be found by taking off the full middle ending off the principal part; when it comes to deponent 3rd principal parts, that means taking off the -άμην (for first aorists) or -όμην (for second aorists). So, in the case of γίγνομαι, that leaves us with the stem ἐγεν- from the third principal part and forms like ἐγένετο or ἐγένοντο.

Some verbs are deponent in only some principal parts. For example, take a look at the dictionary entry above for **ἔρχομαι**, "to come, to go." Its third principal part, ἦλθον, is a straightforward second aorist (active), but its first principal part, ἔρχομαι, with its -ομαι ending, is deponent (properly present tense and middle voice, as we'll learn about in a later unit).

## Practice Opportunity 1

Translate the following sentences into English, using the verb entries above and the [example nouns listed in the verb overview](overview#example-nouns).

[Answer key here](../answer-key#second-aorist-po1).

1. οἱ πολῖται τὴν πόλιν ἤγαγον.
2. ὁ πολίτης ἦλθεν.
3. ὁ ἄνθρωπος τὰ χρήματα εἴχετο.
4. οἱ ἄνθρωποι ἐγένοντο οἱ πολῖται.\*

\* Note that both nouns in this sentence are in the nominative case because the verb ἐγένοντο links them together; they refer to the same entity, so they are in the same case. We'll learn more about this in module 2.
