# Infinitives and Participles

This module introduces two verb forms outside of finite forms that we can use to add information to a sentence: the infinitive, a verbal noun; and the participle, a verb adjective. Throughout this module, you'll become familiar with the formation and uses of the infinitive and the participle.
