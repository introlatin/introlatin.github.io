## Word Order

In English, we usually rely on **word order** to help us understand how words function within a sentence. Take a look at the order of the words in the following two sentences:

* The boy loves the girl.
* The girl loves the boy.

Both sentences use the same words but change the order. In so doing, the picture that each sentence draws is different. In the first, the **boy** performs the action of loving upon the **girl** by virtue of the fact that "the boy" precedes the verb "loves", making him the subject of the verb, while "the girl" follows the verb, making her the direct object of the verb. In the second sentence, however, when we swap "boy" and "girl", suddenly it's the **girl** who performs the action of loving, since she comes before the verb, and it's the **boy** who receives the action of loving, since he comes after. The word order of the sentence helps us understand which noun serves as the subject of the verb and which serves as the object of the verb.

However, although word order does exist in Greek (and we'll discuss its rules throughout the semester), for the most part, we do **not** rely on word order in Greek to help us understand how words function. We can engage in such shenanigans as placing the subject *after* the verb and the direct object *before* it if we wanted to emphasize the subject or object in different ways. We could even begin the sentence with the verb and shuffle the subject and object afterward. Such shuffling would render English sentences difficult to understand, if not entirely nonsensical or ungrammatical:

* Loves the boy the girl. (Wut?)
* The girl the boy loves. (Who's the subject? Who's the object?)

Note, though, how the same Greek sentence can be written in multiple word orders with no difference in the core meaning of the sentence:
* ὁ παῖς φιλεῖ τὴν κόρην. (ὁ παῖς = the boy, φιλεῖ = loves, τὴν κόρην = the girl)
* ὁ παῖς τὴν κόρην φιλεῖ.
* φιλεῖ ὁ παῖς τὴν κόρην.
* φιλεῖ τὴν κόρην ὁ παῖς.
* τὴν κόρην φιλεῖ ὁ παῖς.
* τὴν κόρην ὁ παῖς φιλεῖ.

How, then, can Greek get away with not using word order to indicate a word's function within a sentence?

## Inflection

The answer is a concept called **inflection**. Rather than using word order, Greek will **change the endings of words** to indicate certain functions or qualities of a word in a sentence. So, we can use those word endings to figure out how a word works with a sentence, rather than word order.

For example, in the Greek example above, notice how the word for "girl", κόρην, ends in the letters -ην. This indicates that the noun is in what's called the **accusative case**, which we use in Greek to indicate that a noun is a direct object. If we wanted "girl" to serve a different function in the sentence, we would change its ending; for example, if we wanted "girl" to be the subject (in what's called the **nominative case**), then it would look like this: κόρη, with the ending -η.

There are two major kinds of inflection in Greek: **conjugation** and **declension**.

### Conjugation

**Conjugation** is the act of changing the endings of a **verb** to reflect different aspects of that verb, like who performs the action, when the action occurs, and whether the subject performs or receives the verb's action. When we **conjugate** a verb, we apply various endings to different forms of a verbal stem to reflect those aspects. More on this in Module 1.

### Declension

**Declension** is the act of changing the endings of a **noun** to indicate how many of the noun there are and what function the noun serves in the sentence (e.g., subject, direct object, possessor, etc.). When we **decline** a noun, it means that we change its endings to reflect those aspects of the noun.

**Declension** also refers to the act of changing the endings of an **adjective** such that it matches the noun that it describes in gender, case, and number or of a **pronoun** such that it matches the noun that it's replacing in gender, case, and number. More on this in Module 2.
