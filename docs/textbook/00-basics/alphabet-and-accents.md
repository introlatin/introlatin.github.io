## Alphabet and pronounciation

Latin is a historical language. Although it has never been lost, and has been used continuously for thousands of years, it has survived as a language we must learn as a second language: for many centuries, there have been no native speakers of Latin. In different parts of the world today, scholars use different conventions for pronouncing Latin.  Italians pronounce Latin like Italian, Germans pronounce Latin like German, and the British pronounciation of Latin is hard even to describe.

Americans generally adopt a pronouncation (presented here) that reflects our knowledge of how individual letters and combinations of letter were pronounced, but we should not imagine that we can accurately reproduce the accent of a speaker of classical Latin.

## The classical Latin alphabet: a quick guide

Our alphabet derives directly from the classical Latin alphabet, and has the same letters in the same order, except that classical Latin did not have J, V or W.  Instead the letters I and U were used to write both pure vowel sounds and a semi-vowel or consonant. In addition, in the classical period, K, Y and Z were used only to spell words borrowed from Greek.

### Consonant sounds

Consonants were mostly pronounced as in modern English, with the following notes:

- C and G are always "hard" (like "cut" and "go", never like "cease" or "gyrate").
- S is always unvoiced (like "cease"), never a z-sound (like "ease")
- when I spelled a consonant sound, it was pronounced like English "y" 
- when U spelled a consonant sound, it was pronounced like English "w"
- the double consonant PH came to be pronounced like F

### Vowels

The five vowels a, e, i, o and u have "pure" sounds, without any glide, any  approximately:

| Vowel | English example of sound | Latin word to practice |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | aha | *mater*, "mother" |
| E | deck | *terra*, "earth" |
| I | see | *hic*, "he, this person" | 
| O | no | *homo*, "person, human being" |
| U |  do | *factum*, "deed, accomplishment" | 


Vowels could be long or short; as in a modern language like German, the long version of the vowel was literally held for a longer time than the short version.

Two vowels together could be pronounced as a single *diphthong*: these originally sounded like the two vowels pronounced successively but blending the first into the second.

Try pronouncing the following diphthongs in these Latin words, taken from Hyginus *Fabulae*:

| Diphthong | Latin word |
| --- | --- |
| ae | *quaero*, "I seek" |
| au  | *autem*, "however" |
| ei | *Deianira*, a wife of Hercules  |
| eu | *Theseus*, an Athenian hero | 
| oe | *poena*, "penalty, punishment" |
| ui | *fluit*, "it flows" |


### Orthography

Like the inscriptions and papyri surviving from the classical period, many Latin manuscripts and printed editions of Latin texts use only I and U.  Others use I for both vocalic and consontal sounds, but distinguish U and V. Still others use I, J, U and V.  Long and short vowels were not distinguished in writing.

In this text book, when we introduce forms and new vocabulary, we will sometimes include long and short marks on vowels, but when we cite passages of Hyginus, we will normally write vowels without quantity mark, and will use only I and U (not J and V) .

## Syllables and accent

### Syllables and their quantity

Latin words have as many syllables as there are vowels or diphthongs: *Her-cu-les* *poe-na*, *quae-ro*.

A syllable is **long** if:

1. it has a long vowel or a diphthong, (e.g., the first syllable of *Rō-ma* is long)
2. *or* a short vowel is followed by a cluster of two consonants, (e.g, the first syllable of *Her-cu-les* is long because the *e* is followed by two consonants, *rc*)
3. *except* that the cluster is **short** if the cluster is *l* or *r* following one of :  *b, d, g, p, t, c,* or the combination *ph* (e.g., the first syllable of *pă-tris* is short because the cluster after a short vowel is *t* followed by *r*).

Other syllables with short vowels are **short** (e.g., the second syllable of *Her-cŭ-les* is short).

### Accent

Every Latin word with more than one syllable had a stress accent on either the next to last syllable (sometimes called the **penult**), or the one before it (the **antepenult**).  The placement of the accent depends on whether the next to last syllable is long or short.  If the penult is long, then it is accented; otherwise, the syllable before it  is accented. This rule is called the **Law of the Penultimate**. Examples:

- *a-mī-cus*, "friend," has a long penult:  pronounce it *amícus*.
- *Her-cŭ-les* has a short penult: pronounce it *Hércules*

If a word has only two syllables, the penult is accented no matter what:

- pronounce *căp-ŭt*, "head" as *cáput*.
