## Adjective Degree

**Adjectives** have a **gender, case, and number**, each of which can be changed to match the noun that the adjective describes. We indicate the declension of an adjective by changing its ending depending on the declension group that it belongs to (e.g., 2-1-2 versus 3-1-3, 2-termination vowel declension versus 2-termination consonant declension).

This unit introduces a fourth aspect of adjectives: **degree**, which indicates the **amount of the adjectival quality** that the noun possesses, especially in comparison to other nouns that possess that quality. Look at the following English examples.

* That boy is **fast**.
* That boy is **faster** than the other boy.
* That boy is the **fastest** of all.

The boy in each of these sentences is fast, but the second and third sentences indicate that he has **more** speed than someone else or the **most** speed of anyone being compared to him.

These degrees are termed as follows:
* The **positive** degree of an adjective is the base level.
* The **comparative** degree of an adjective indicates that the noun being described has **more** of the adjectival quality than others. It is best translated as "**more** [adjective]" or, if the English adjective allows, "[adjective]**er**."
* The **superlative** degree of an adjective indicates that the noun being described has the **most** of the adjectival quality compared to anyone else who possesses it. It is best translated as "**most** [adjective]" or, if the English adjective allows, "[adjective]**est**."

The comparative and superlative degrees can also indicate individual amounts of an adjectival quality, rather than highlighting comparisons against others. This means that they can also be translated in the following ways:

* **comparative**: "too [adjective]", "rather [adjective]"
* **superlative**: "very [adjective]"

## Formation

Like the other aspects of adjectives, **degree** is most often indicated by **endings** that attach to the adjective's stem, itself formed from the positive degree of the adjective. The focus here will be on identification of forms, rather than generation, since some of the stem changes between degrees are unintuitive.

### Comparative

Comparative adjectives can be formed in two ways:

**1) by pairing the positive degree of the adjective with the adverb μᾶλλον, "more"**. This works similarly to the English formation of a comparative with "more."

* οἵδε οἱ ἄνδρες **μᾶλλον ἄδικοί** εἰσιν. These men are **more unjust**.

**2) by adding specific endings to the positive form of the adjective.** Comparative adjectives can exhibit one of two types of endings.

* **-(ο/ω)τερος, -(ο/ω)τερα, -(ο/ω)τερον** (2-1-2 pattern)

This set of endings applies to many vowel-declension and consonant-declension adjectives that we know.

In 2-1-2s, the ο or ω is inserted between the adjective stem and the -τερος, -η, -ον endings when the adjective stem ends in a long syllable (i.e., with a diphthong or a long single vowel) or a short syllable, respectively. For example: δίκαιος > δικαιότερος, "more just", since the -αι- at the end of the δικαι- adjective stem is long; ἄδικος > ἀδικώτερος, "more unjust", since the -ι- in ἀδικ- is short.

In -ης, -ες adjectives, the -τερος, -α, -ον ending gets attached directly to the sigma stem of the adjective (e.g., ἀληθεσ- > ἀληθέστερος, "truer").

The comparative of adjectives like σώφρων, σῶφρον, actually uses a stem that borrows the -εσ- conceit from sigma-stem adjectives, creating the form σωφρονέστερος, "wiser."

In -υς, -εια, -υ adjectives, the -τερος, -α, -ον ending gets attached directly to the upsilon stem. For example, βαρύς adds -τερος directly to the root βαρυ- to form βαρύτερος, "heavier."

Note the following examples:

* οἱ δικασταὶ **δικαιότεροι** ἦσαν. The jurors were **more just**.
* ὁ ἱππεὺς **ἀδικώτερος** ἐστίν. The cavalryman is **more unjust**.
* ὁ παῖς ἀκήκοεν τοὺς λόγους τοὺς **ἀληθεστέρους**. The child has heard **truer** / **more true** words.
* ἔχω τὰ τοῦ **σωφρονεστέρου** μαθητοῦ βιβλία. I have the books of the **wiser** student.
* ὁρῶμεν τὴν **βαρυτέραν** τριήρη. We see the **heavier** ship.

In all instances, the common denominator of the comparative is the -τερος, -τερα, -τερον ending on an adjective that you would otherwise normally recognize.

Other types of adjectives, especially those with irregular comparative forms, will exhibit the following endings:

* **-(ι)ων, -(ι)ον (stem -(ι)ον-)** (consonant declension, 2-termination pattern)

[The chart below](#irregular-comparatives-and-superlatives) exhibits the adjectives that we have encountered so far that exhibit this declension pattern in their comparative forms. Often, this is simply a matter of repeated exposure to these forms, since it is impossible to know without an advanced linguistics degree why we get, for example, the comparative ἀμείνων, ἄμεινον from the positive ἀγαθός.

Note that the declension of -(ι)ων, -(ι)ον comparatives generally follows the patterns that we learned about with σώφρον, σῶφρον back in [Adjectives in the first semester](../nouns/adjectives#two-termination-3), with optional contracted forms in the m./f. acc. sg. and nom. and acc. forms in all three genders:

| | Masc./Fem. | Neut. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | ἀμείνων | ἄμεινον |
| Gen. Sg. | ἀμείνονος | ἀμείνονος |
| Dat. Sg. | ἀμείνονι | ἀμείνονι |
| Acc. Sg. | ἀμείνονα or ἀμείνω | ἄμεινον |
| Nom. Pl. | ἀμείνονες or ἀμείνους | ἀμείνονα or ἀμείνω |
| Gen. Pl. | ἀμεινόνων | ἀμεινόνων |
| Dat. Pl. | ἀμείνοσι(ν) | ἀμείνοσι(ν) |
| Acc. Pl. | ἀμείνονας or ἀμείνους | ἀμείνονα or ἀμείνω |

* οἱ **μείζους** βοῦς ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ ἔρχονται. The **greater** / **larger** bulls are coming from the road.
* ἐγὼ τοὺς πολίτας τοὺς **ἀμείνονας** παρὰ τὴν οἰκίαν εἶδον. I saw the **more noble** citizens near the house.

### Superlative

Superlatives, like comparatives, have two main methods of formation.

**1) by pairing the positive degree of the adjective with the adverb μάλιστα, "most"**. This works similarly to the English formation of a comparative with "most."

* οὗτοι οἱ ἄνδρες **μάλιστα ἄδικοί** εἰσιν. Those men are the **most unjust**.

**2) by adding specific endings to the positive form of the adjective.** Like the comparative, these endings will vary depending on the kind of adjective in question but generally follow one of two patterns:

* -(ο/ω)τατος, -(ο/ω)τατη, -(ο/ω)τατον (2-1-2 pattern)
* -ιστος, -ιστη, -ιστον (2-1-2 pattern)

The first is used for the same adjectives on which you'd use -τερος, -α, -ον for the comparative. The second is used for most of the irregular superlatives [in the chart below](#irregular-comparatives-and-superlatives).

* λέγω τοῖς **δικαιοτάτοις** δικασταῖς. I am speaking to the **most just** jurors.
* οἱ **ἀληθέστατοι** λόγοι ὑπ' ἐκείνου ἐλέγοντο. The **truest** words were being spoken by that man.
* οἱ **κράτιστοι** ἄνδρες τὸν ποταμὸν διαβαίνουσιν. The **strongest** men are crossing the river.

### Irregular Comparatives and Superlatives

This chart indicates comparatives and superlatives that are irregular, in the sense that their forms cannot necessarily be intuited from the stem of the positive degree of the adjective. Their declension patterns will follow regular patterns as delineated above; it is merely the stems that are irregular.

| Positive | Comparative | Superlative |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| ἡδύς | ἡδίων | ἥδιστος |
| ἀγαθός | - ἀμείνων (better, more noble, more excellent)<br>- βελτίων (better, more virtuous)<br>- κρείττων (better, more powerful) | - ἄριστος (best, most excellent)<br>- βέλτιστος (best, most virtuous)<br>- κράτιστος (best, most powerful) |
| κακός | - κακίων (worse)<br>- χείρων (worse)<br>- ἥττων (weaker, inferior, fewer) | - κάκιστος<br>- χείριστος<br>- ἥκιστος |
| καλός | καλλίων | κάλλιστος |
| μέγας | μείζων | μέγιστος |
| πολύς | πλείων or πλέων | πλεῖστος |
| μίκρος | - μικρότερος<br>- ἐλάττων | - μικρότατος<br>- ἐλάχιστος |
| ὀλίγος | ὀλείζων | ὀλίγιστος |
| ταχύς | θάττων | τάχιστος |

## Constructions with Comparative or Superlative

### Comparative with ἤ or Genitive of Comparison

A comparative adjective at its core *compares* two nouns in terms of which possesses more of the adjectival quality **than** the other. For example, in English:

* This citizen is more just **than** that one.

As we compare who is more just, we use the bridge word "than" to compare "this citizen" versus "that citizen."

There are two ways to do this in Greek. The first is to use the conjunction **ἤ** to indicate "than":

* ὅδε ὁ πολίτης ἐστὶ δικαιότερος **ἢ ἐκεῖνος**.

The noun being compared via ἤ will be in the same **case** as the original noun. Note the following rewrite of the previous example:

* ὁ παῖς νομίζει τόνδε τὸν πολίτην εἶναι δικαιότερον **ἢ ἐκεῖνον**. The child thinks that this man is more just **than that one**.

The second method is to use a **genitive of comparison**: a noun in the **genitive case** can replace the ἤ + noun comparison.

* ὅδε ὁ πολίτης δικαιότερος **ἐκείνου** ἐστίν. This citizen is more just **than that one**.
* ὁ παῖς νομίζει τόνδε τὸν πολίτην **ἐκείνου** δικαιότερον εἶναι. The child thinks that this man is more just **than that one**.

#### Dative of Degree of Difference

The neuter dative singular of the adjective **πολύς** (**πολλῷ**) or the adjective ὀλίγος (**ὀλίγῳ**) can be used to indicate by how much the nouns differ in the amount of the adjectival quality that they possess: "a lot" or "much" (πολλῷ) or "a little" (ὀλίγῳ).

* ὁ δικαστὴς **πολλῷ** ἀδικώτερος τοῦ πολίτου ἦν. The juror was **a lot** more unjust than the citizen.
* ὁ ἵππος **ὀλίγῳ** εὐτυχέστερος τοῦ βοός ἐστιν. The horse is **a little** luckier than the bull.

### Partitive Genitive with Superlatives

The genitive case can be used with a superlative adjective to indicate the group of which the noun being described is a part. Hence, this use is called the **partitive genitive**, and it is best translated using the default genitive translation "of":

* οὗτος εὐτυχέστατος **πάντων** ἦν. That man was luckiest **of all**.
* ἥδε μεγίστη **τῶν νέων** ἐστίν. This is the largest **of the ships**.

### Superlative with ὡς / ὅτι

**ὡς** or **ὅτι** plus a superlative adjective is translated as "as [adjective] as possible."

* ἡ ἵππος **ὅτι ταχίστη** ἐστίν. The horse is **as swift as possible**.

***

## Adverbs and Adverbial Accusatives

**Adverbs** are words that qualify the action of a verb or modify an adjective or other adverbs. We've seen examples

Many adjectives, especially vowel-declension adjectives, can form an adverb in the positive degree by adding the ending **-ως**:

* ὁ πολίτης **ἀδίκως** ἔλεγεν. The citizen was speaking **unjustly**.

However, the **neuter accusative singular** and the **neuter accusative plural** of many adjectives can also be used to create adverbs. Often, translations of such **adverbial accusatives** can use the **"-ly"** form of the adjective (e.g., swift > swiftly) or add other words like "in an [adjective] way/manner." Note the following examples of **adverbial accusatives** formed from the positive degrees of adjectives that we know:

* ὁ μαθητὴς τὸν διδάσκαλον **μέγα** ἐτιμήσεν. The student honored the teacher **greatly**.
* ἐκεῖνος τούτους τοὺς ἀγῶνας **πολλὰ** ἐνίκα. That man was winning those contests **much** / **many times** / **often**.

This is also the case for comparatives and superlatives, though more narrowly delineated: a comparative adverbial accusative can be formed from the **neuter accusative singular** form, while a superlative adverbial accusative can be formed from the **neuter accusative plural**.

* ὁ ἀνὴρ **ἀσθενέστερον** τὰ ὅπλα ἔβαλεν. The man threw the weapons **more weakly** / **rather weakly**.
* ὁ πολίτης **ἥδιστα** λέγει. The citizen speaks **most sweetly**. (or, The citizen says most sweet things. / The citizen says very sweet things.)
