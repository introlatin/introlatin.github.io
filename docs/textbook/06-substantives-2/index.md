# Substantives and Adjectives 2

This module introduces new material relating to substantives and adjectives in ancient Greek that builds upon the foundational knowledge that we began learning about in the first semester. Topics for this module include variable-stem nouns and adjectives; personal, reflexive, reciprocal, interrogative, and indefinite pronouns; and comparative and superlative adjectives.
