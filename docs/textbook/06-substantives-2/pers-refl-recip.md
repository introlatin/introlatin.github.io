## Pronouns

Last semester, we learned about [pronouns](../nouns/pronouns), words that stand in for a noun called an **antecedent**. The pronoun has to *agree* in **gender and number** with the antecedent, but its **case** fits the use of the pronoun within its own clause. The different types of pronouns that we encountered last semester include **demonstratives**, which point things out (e.g., ὅδε, ἥδε, τόδε or ἐκεῖνος, ἐκείνη, ἐκεῖνο) and the **relative pronoun** (ὅς, ἥ, ὅ, "who, which, that").

This unit introduces three new kinds of pronouns: **personal pronouns**, **reflexive pronouns**, and the **reciprocal pronoun**.

***

## Personal Pronouns

**Personal pronouns** are closely related to the idea of a **verb's person**; these are pronouns like "I", "you", or "they" that indicate a speaker's relationship to a sentence. Note that these pronouns are not limited to serving as the subjects of a verb, however; they can also be direct objects, possessors, indirect objects, etc.

* ***I*** saw the ships.
* The horse carried ***us*** into the road.
* ***We*** said true things to ***you***.

A personal pronoun, like any other pronoun, will have a **case, gender, and number**. In addition, however, another aspect that a personal pronoun will have is **person**: 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, with the same meanings as a verb's person. Person plus number yields the different kinds of personal pronouns, which are declined in the sections to follow.

One general item of note: **the nominative forms of these pronouns are used only for emphasis or to disambiguate between different subjects**. This makes intuitive sense, since the **verb** tells us who the subject is; a nominative subject is superfluous and unnecessary in that sense.

### First Person Personal
{: .no_toc }

* I, me (singular); we, us (plural)

| | Regular | Non-Emphatic |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | ἐγώ | -- |
| Gen. Sg. | ἐμοῦ | μου |
| Dat. Sg. | ἐμοί | μοι |
| Acc. Sg. | ἐμέ | με |
| Nom. Pl. | ἡμεῖς | -- |
| Gen. Pl. | ἡμῶν | -- |
| Dat. Pl. | ἡμῖν | -- |
| Acc. Pl. | ἡμᾶς | -- |

Note that the non-emphatic forms of the pronoun are interchangeable with the regular forms of the pronoun, and they are all enclitics that tend to be post-positive:

* ὁ παῖς ἐμοὶ πολλὰ ἔλεγεν. The child was saying many things to me.

is exactly equivalent to

* ὁ παῖς μοι πολλὰ ἔλεγεν.

As the last example indicates, cases work as we expect them to: as direct objects, subjects of infinitives, possessors, etc.

* ὁ ἵππος πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἦλθεν. The horse came towards us.
* οἱ λόγοι μου ἐν τῷ βιβλίῳ ἐγράφοντο. My words (lit. "The words of me") were being written in the book.
* ἡ μήτηρ ἐκέλευσεν ἐμὲ τὰ ὅπλα λαβεῖν. My mother ordered me to take the weapons.

### Second Person Personal
{: .no_toc }

* you (singular); you, you all, y'all (plural)

| | Regular | Non-Emphatic |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | σύ | -- |
| Gen. Sg. | σοῦ | σου |
| Dat. Sg. | σοί | σοι |
| Acc. Sg. | σέ | σε |
| Nom. Pl. | ὑμεῖς | -- |
| Gen. Pl. | ὑμῶν | -- |
| Dat. Pl. | ὑμῖν | -- |
| Acc. Pl. | ὑμᾶς | -- |

Like the first person pronoun, the second person pronoun has unemphatic forms that are post-positive enclitics.

* πρέπει ὑμῖν ἀγαθὰ λέγειν. It is fitting for you all to say good things.
* ὁ πατὴρ σοῦ τὴν ὁδὸν ἐμοὶ ἔδειξεν. Your father (lit. "The father of you") showed the road to me.

### Third Person Personal
{: .no_toc }

We have already encountered two pronouns that indicate third-person forms (he/him/his, she/her/hers, it/its, they/them/their):

* αὐτός, αὐτή, αὐτό
* the definite article ὁ, ἡ, τό

For a reminder on how to use these forms, you can refer back to last semester's unit on Pronouns for the sections on [αὐτός, αὐτή, αὐτό](../nouns/pronouns#αὐτός-αὐτή-αὐτό) and [the article](../nouns/pronouns#definite-articles).

## Reflexive Pronouns

The **reflexive pronoun** is used to **reflect** the action of a verb back at a subject. Take a look at the following examples in English:

* I saw **myself** in the mirror.
* You brought **yourselves** to this point.
* He taught **himself** the perfect tense.

In each of these sentences, the subject of the sentence performs the action upon themself, *reflecting* the verb's action backwards. For this reason, **the reflexive pronoun has no nominative case**; it exists solely to redirect a verb's action back at the subject in any of the other cases (genitive, dative, or accusative).

Like the personal pronoun, the reflexive pronoun also has a **person** (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) that matches the person of the main verb in the sentence.

### First Person Reflexive
{: .no_toc }

* myself (singular); ourselves (plural)

| | Masculine | Feminine |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | -- | -- |
| Gen. Sg. | ἐμαυτοῦ | ἐμαυτῆς |
| Dat. Sg. | ἐμαυτῷ | ἐμαυτῇ |
| Acc. Sg. | ἐμαυτόν | ἐμαυτήν |
| Nom. Pl. | -- | -- |
| Gen. Pl. | ἡμῶν αὐτῶν | ἡμῶν αὐτῶν |
| Dat. Pl. | ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς | ἡμῖν αὐταῖς |
| Acc. Pl. | ἡμᾶς αὐτούς | ἡμᾶς αὐτάς |

Note that the plural forms are a combination of the personal pronoun (the ἡμ- forms) with an appropriately declined form of αὐτός. There is no neuter for the first person since it is unlikely that a neuter entity would be speak and refer to itself in the first person.

A reflexive pronoun's person and number should match the person and number of a main verb. Note the following examples:

* εἶδον ἐμαυτὸν ἐν τῇ θαλάττῃ. I saw *myself* in the sea. (first person singular)
* τὰ βιβλία ἡμῶν αὐτῶν ἠνέγκομεν. We brought *our own* books (lit. "the books of ourselves"). (first person plural)

### Second Person Reflexive
{: .no_toc }

* yourself (singular); yourselves (plural)

| | Masculine | Feminine |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | -- | -- |
| Gen. Sg. | σεαυτοῦ / σαυτοῦ | σεαυτῆς / σαυτῆς |
| Dat. Sg. | σεαυτῷ / σαυτῷ | σεαυτῇ / σαυτῇ |
| Acc. Sg. | σεαυτόν / σαυτόν | σεαυτήν / σαυτήν |
| Nom. Pl. | -- | -- |
| Gen. Pl. | ὑμῶν αὐτῶν | ὑμῶν αὐτῶν |
| Dat. Pl. | ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς | ὑμῖν αὐταῖς |
| Acc. Pl. | ὑμᾶς αὐτούς | ὑμᾶς αὐτάς |

Note that each singular form has two versions: one with an -ε- after the initial σ- and one without. The plural again is a combination of the personal pronoun (the ὑμ- forms) with an appropriately declined form of αὐτός.

* ἀληθῆ σεαυτῇ εἶπες. You said true things to yourself.
* ὑμᾶς αὐτοὺς τιμᾶτε, τοῦ κινδύνου δεδηλωμένου. You honor yourselves because the danger has been pointed out.

### Third Person Reflexive
{: .no_toc }

* himself, herself, itself, themself, themselves

| | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | -- | -- | -- |
| Gen. Sg. | ἑαυτοῦ / αὑτοῦ | ἑαυτῆς / αὑτῆς | ἑαυτοῦ / αὑτοῦ |
| Dat. Sg. | ἑαυτῷ / αὑτῷ | ἑαυτῇ / αὑτῇ | ἑαυτῷ / αὑτῷ |
| Acc. Sg. | ἑαυτόν / αὑτόν | ἑαυτήν / αὑτήν | ἑαυτό / αὑτό |
| Nom. Pl. | -- | -- |
| Gen. Pl. | ἑαυτῶν / αὑτῶν | ἑαυτῶν / αὑτῶν | ἑαυτῶν / αὑτῶν |
| Dat. Pl. | ἑαυτοῖς / αὑτοῖς | ἑαυταῖς / αὑταῖς | ἑαυτοῖς / αὑτοῖς |
| Acc. Pl. | ἑαυτούς / αὑτούς | ἑαυτάς / αὑτάς | ἑαυτά / αὑτά |

Each of the third person reflexives has two forms: a form that begins with ἑ- and a form that contracts that ἑ- into the -αυ- that follows it. **Be very careful about the forms that begin with αυ-** -- the only difference between the 3rd person *reflexive* pronoun and the 3rd person *personal* pronoun is that the former uses a rough breathing while the latter uses a smooth breathing.

* αὑτὸν πρὸς τὴν θάλατταν ἤγαγεν. He led *himself* toward the sea.
* αὐτὸν πρὸς τὴν θάλατταν ἤγαγεν. He led *him* (i.e., someone other than the subject) toward the sea.

***

## Reciprocal Pronoun

The **reciprocal pronoun** indicates that two people or two groups of people perform a verbal action upon each other; hence, the action is *reciprocal*. The reciprocal pronoun is best translated as "each other" or "one another" and, like the reflexive pronoun, does not exist in the nominative case.

| | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Pl. | -- | -- | -- |
| Gen. Pl. | ἀλλήλων | ἀλλήλων | ἀλλήλων |
| Dat. Pl. | ἀλλήλοις | ἀλλήλαις | ἀλλήλοις |
| Acc. Pl. | ἀλλήλους | ἀλλήλας | ἄλληλα |

* οἱ ἵπποι ἀλλήλους ὁρῶσιν. The horses see one another.
* οἱ πολῖται ἀλλήλοις εἶπον. The citizens spoke to each other.
