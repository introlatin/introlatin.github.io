## Third-Declension Nouns

Last semester, we learned that nouns of the **third declension**, also known as the consonant declension, share endings that indicate its different cases and numbers.

| | Masc./Fem. | Neut. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | --, -ς | -- |
| Gen. Sg. | -ος | -ος |
| Dat. Sg. | -ι | -ι |
| Acc. Sg. | -α | same as nom. |
| Nom. Pl. | -ες | -α |
| Gen. Pl. | -ων | -ων |
| Dat. Pl. | -σι(ν) | -σι(ν) |
| Acc. Pl. | -ας | -α |

The identification of a third declension noun is based on its dictionary entry: its genitive singular form usually ends in -ος. Last semester, I also alluded to the fact that there are third declension nouns with a genitive singular in -εως and -ους, even -ως.

This unit will discuss those cases and how those nouns decline, because they will include more steps than simply adding an ending to a noun stem. In some cases, endings will *contract* with a stem vowel, similarly to epsilon-contract verbs. In other cases, the stem of the noun in question will actually vary from case to case and number to number. Patterns of stem-changing or obscured stem vowels will often be difficult to discern, so it is more a matter of recognizing that a noun can be categorized as a variable-stem and using your knowledge of noun endings and vowel contractions (plus external clues like articles or adjectives) to figure out what case and number the noun in question is.

## Rho-stem Nouns

Third declension nouns whose noun stem ends in the letter -ρ- will often exhibit a **variable stem**. That means that the noun stem that you get when you take the -ος off the genitive form (the usual way that we get a noun stem) will actually *change spelling* in certain cases and numbers. The following are a list of common -ρ- stem nouns that you should be aware of:

* πατήρ, πατρός, m. - father
  * expected stem: πατρ-
* μήτηρ, μητρός, f. - mother
  * expected stem: μητρ-
* θυγάτηρ, θυγατρός, f. - daughter
  * expected stem: θυγατρ-
* χείρ, χειρός, f. - hand
  * expected stem: χειρ-

The following is a declension chart for these nouns, and note in particular the bolded forms: these forms will exhibit a different spelling than the stem you would expect from the genitive singular form of the noun.

| | πατήρ | μήτηρ | θυγάτηρ | χείρ |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | πατήρ | μήτηρ | θυγάτηρ | χείρ |
| Gen. Sg. | πατρός | μητρός | θυγατρός | χειρός |
| Dat. Sg. | πατρί | μητρί | θυγατρί | χειρί |
| Acc. Sg. | **πατέρα** | **μητέρα** | **θυγατέρα** | χεῖρα |
| Nom. Pl. | **πατέρες** | **μητέρες** | **θυγατέρες** | χεῖρες |
| Gen. Pl. | **πατέρων** | **μητέρων** | **θυγατέρων** | χειρῶν |
| Dat. Pl. | **πατράσι(ν)** | **μητράσι(ν)** | **θυγατράσι(ν)** | **χερσί(ν)** |
| Acc. Pl. | **πατέρας** | **μητέρας** | **θυγατέρας** | χεῖρας |

Note that in most of the forms of πατήρ, μήτηρ, and θυγάτηρ, there is an extra -ε- inserted before the -ρ- of the stem. The dative plural of all three forms compensates on the other side of the -ρ- by adding an -α- before the -σι(ν) ending.

In χείρ, the diphthong ει downgrades to an -ε- in the dative plural.

## Sigma-stem Nouns

Third declension nouns with a genitive singular in **-ους** or **-ως** (note: just -ως and not -εως, which we'll discuss in the next section) actually use the same endings that all third-declension nouns do, even if the -ους or -ως seems to indicate otherwise. That is because these nouns are properly considered **sigma-stems**, meaning that the stem of the noun properly ends in the letter sigma. However, a sigma that occurs between two vowels (a so-called **intervocalic sigma**) tends to disappear, and the clash of the vowels on either side of it will result in a **contraction**, exactly similar to the epsilon- or alpha-contractions that we learned about with verbs. So, make sure to review the [full contractions lists here](../../reference/contractions), in particular the epsilon and alpha contractions.

Take a look at this example:

* γένος, γένους, n. - family, class, kind

The actual stem of this noun is **γενεσ-**, to which are added the regular third declension endings. In the genitive singular, this means that to the stem **γενεσ-** we add the ending **-ος**, which should result in the form **γένεσος**. However, the sigma between the -ε- and the -ο- is intervocalic and thus drops out, leaving us with **γένεος**. Then, the -ε- of the stem and the -ο- of the ending will contract into an **-ου-**, according to the same **epsilon contraction rules** that we already know. Thus, our final form is **γένους**.

Here is a chart that indicates the contracted forms of the noun γένος along with the uncontracted elements that lead to them:

| | stem + ending | final form |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | -- | γένος |
| Gen. Sg. | γεν**ε**(σ)- + -**ο**ς | γέν**ου**ς |
| Dat. Sg. | γεν**ε**(σ)- + -**ι** | γένει\* |
| Acc. Sg. | -- | γένος\*\* |
| Nom. Pl. | γεν**ε**(σ)- + -**α** | γέν**η** |
| Gen. Pl. | γεν**ε**(σ)- + -**ω**ν | γεν**ῶ**ν |
| Dat. Pl. | γεν**ε**(σ)- + -**σ**ι(ν) | γένεσι(ν)\*\*\* |
| Acc. Pl. | γεν**ε**(σ)- + -**α** | γέν**η** |

\* In the dative singular, note that -ι technically just adds to the -ε- of the stem to form the ending -ει; it is not technically a contraction but an addition.  
\*\* Recall that the accusative singular of a neuter noun is exactly similar to its nominative singular.   
\*\*\* In the dative plural, the double sigmas (at the end of the stem and at the beginning of the ending) smush together into a single sigma sound, but it does not disappear intervocalically due to its origins as a double sigma sound.

This same process applies to third declension masculine/feminine nouns with a nominative in **-ης** and a genitive in **-ους**, like τριήρης, τριήρους, f. - trireme (a type of warship):

| | stem + ending | final form |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | -- | τριήρης |
| Gen. Sg. | τριηρ**ε**(σ)- + -**ο**ς | τριήρ**ου**ς |
| Dat. Sg. | τριηρ**ε**(σ)- + -**ι** | τριήρ**ει** |
| Acc. Sg. | τριηρ**ε**(σ)- + -**α** | τριήρ**η** |
| Nom. Pl. | τριηρ**ε**(σ)- + -**ε**ς | τριήρ**ει**ς |
| Gen. Pl. | τριηρ**ε**(σ)- + -**ω**ν | τριηρ**ῶ**ν |
| Dat. Pl. | τριηρ**ε**(σ)- + -**σ**ι(ν) | τριήρεσι(ν) |
| Acc. Pl. | τριηρ**ε**(σ)- + -**α**ς | τριήρ**ει**ς\* |

\* Note that the contraction in the accusative plural is an exception to our contraction rules; we would expect the ending -ης here to result from the combination of -ε- and -α-, but instead we have an ending that looks similar to the nominative plural: -εις.

One other noun to be aware of that follows the sigma-stem pattern is γέρας, γέρως, n. - gift, prize. However, the vowel on the left side of the intervocalic sigma is -α-, rather than -ε-, so its contractions follow **alpha contraction patterns**.

| | stem + ending | final form |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | -- | γέρας |
| Gen. Sg. | γερ**α**(σ)- + -**ο**ς | γέρ**ω**ς |
| Dat. Sg. | γερ**α**(σ)- + -**ι** | γέρᾳ\* |
| Acc. Sg. | -- | γέρας |
| Nom. Pl. | γερ**α**(σ)- + -**α** | γέρ**ᾱ** |
| Gen. Pl. | γερ**α**(σ)- + -**ω**ν | γερ**ῶ**ν |
| Dat. Pl. | γερ**α**(σ)- + -**σ**ι(ν) | γέρασι(ν) |
| Acc. Pl. | γερ**α**(σ)- + -**α** | γέρ**ᾱ** |

\* In the dative singular, note that -ι technically just adds to the -α- of the stem to form the ending -ᾳ; it is not technically a contraction but an addition.

## True Variable-Stem Nouns

Other third declension nouns exhibit true and unpredictable variability in their stems due to the remnants of vowel changes and noun usage over time. While some of these nouns are extremely common and their variable forms should be memorized (like πόλις in the [Unit Vocabulary](#unit-vocabulary)), others can be dealt with on a case-by-case basis with the help of a paradigm chart.

* πόλις, πόλεως, f. - city (stem in πολι-, πολη-, or πολε-)

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. | πόλις | πόλεις |
| Gen. | πόλεως\* | πόλεων |
| Dat. | πόλει | πόλεσι(ν) |
| Acc. | πόλιν\*\* | πόλεις\*\*\* |

\* The ending -εως is the result of a process called quantitative metathesis, the switching around of vowel quantities from long-short to short-long. The true form of the genitive singular uses the stem πολη- with the ending -ος, which should yield ποληος; however, the long η and the short ο swap quantities/lengths to the short ε and the long ω respectively, resulting in the form πόλεως. This is the reason why the accent remains on the first syllable rather than being drawn forward to the -ε-.  
\*\* Note that a two-syllable third declension noun with a nominative ending in -ις and an accent on its first syllable exhibits this -ν ending in the accusative singular rather than the expected -α ending for the third declension.  
\*\*\* Like τριήρης, the accusative plural of πόλις seems to borrow its form from the nominative plural: πόλεις.

* ναῦς, νέως, f. - ship (stem in ναυ-, νη-, or νε-)

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. | ναῦς | νῆες |
| Gen. | νέως | νεῶν |
| Dat. | νηΐ\* | ναυσί(ν) |
| Acc. | ναῦν\*\* | ναῦς\*\*\* |

* βοῦς, βοός, m./f. - bull, cow (stem in βου- or βο-)

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. | βοῦς | βόες |
| Gen. | βοός | βοῶν |
| Dat. | βοΐ\* | βουσί(ν) |
| Acc. | βοῦν\*\* | βοῦς\*\*\* |

\* Note the diaerisis (two dots) above the -ι of the ending. This indicates that this vowel should be pronounced distinctly from the vowel that precedes it; they do not form a single diphthong sound but rather two distinct syllables (νηΐ = nay-ee; βοΐ = bo-ee).  
\*\* Like πόλις, ναῦς and βοῦς will exhibit the -ν ending in the accusative singular: ναῦν and βοῦν respectively.  
\*\*\* The accusative plural looks exactly like the nominative singular; you will need to use context like an article (ἡ ναῦς versus τὰς ναῦς, ὁ βοῦς versus τοὺς βοῦς) or an adjective (μίκρα ναῦς versus μίκρας ναῦς, μίκρος βοῦς versus μίκρους βοῦς) to differentiate between the two.

* ἱππεύς, ἱππέως, m. - cavalryman, horse-rider (stem in ἱππευ-, ἱππη-, or ἱππε-)

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. | ἱππεύς | ἱππεῖς or ἱππῆς |
| Gen. | ἱππέως | ἱππέων |
| Dat. | ἱππεῖ\* | ἱππεῦσι(ν) |
| Acc. | ἱππέᾱ\* | ἱππέᾱς\* |

\* These forms exhibit quantitative metathesis on the stem ἱππη-, hence the long iota in the dat. sg. and long alphas in the accusative forms, whereas normally they are all short.
