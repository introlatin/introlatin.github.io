## Consonant-Declension Adjectives

Last semester, we learned about [consonant-declension adjectives](../nouns/adjectives#consonant-declension-1) that are broadly split into two major categories: **three-termination or 3-1-3s**, which exhibit third-declension endings in the masculine and neuter forms and first-declension (alpha/eta) endings in the feminine forms; and **two-termination**, which have one set of forms for masculine and feminine and another set for neuter.

This unit will discuss mixed-declension or new kinds of consonant-declension adjectives, including adjectives with variable stems (e.g., μέγας and πολύς), adjectives that exhibit similar contractions to [variable-stem nouns](variable-stem-nouns) (e.g., 3-1-3s in -υς, -εια, -υ, or two-termination adjectives in -ης, -ες), and some that do not decline at all (e.g., numerals from 5 up).

## Variable-Stem Adjectives

The adjectives μέγας and πολύς should, according to their dictionary entries, look like consonant-declension adjectives:

* μέγας, μεγάλη, μέγα - big, great
* πολύς, πολλή, πολύ - much (singular); many (plural)

Recall that *vowel*-declension adjectives generally have endings in -ος, -η/-α, -ον or -ος, -ον, and adjectives that do not fall into that pattern are generally *consonant*-declension adjectives. However, μέγας and πολύς exhibit mostly *vowel*-declension patterns, with the sole exceptions being their masculine and neuter nominative and accusative singular forms:

* μέγας > stem in μεγάλ- or μεγα-

## -υς and -ης Adjectives

In the [Unit Vocabulary](#unit-vocabulary) above, two adjectives fall into the familiar patterns from last semester: **μέλας** and **χαρίεις** are both 3-1-3 adjectives with their masculine and neuter stems indicated in the dictionary entry and declension patterns that operate according to the usual rules (consonant-declension endings for masculine and neuter forms, alpha/eta-declension endings for feminine forms).

The other adjectives in the 3-1-3 section of the Unit Vocabulary and all of the adjectives in the two-termination section will follow specific declension patterns that look similar to some of the patterns that you learned about with [variable-stem nouns](variable-stem-nouns).

### -υς, -εια, -υ Adjectives

3-1-3s with a dictionary entry in **-υς, -εια, -υ** will have declension patterns that look similar to πόλις in the masculine and neuter. One major difference is that the genitive singular will remain in -εος, rather than -εως.

Let's take, for example, the adjective **βαρύς, βαρεῖα, βαρύ - heavy**. Its masculine/neuter stem varies between βαρυ- and βαρε-, but forms built on the latter stem will *not* contract with the vowel of the ending. However, the feminine forms, as usual, will follow regular alpha/eta declension patterns.

| | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | βαρύς | βαρεῖα | βαρύ |
| Gen. Sg. | βαρέος | βαρείας | βαρέος |
| Dat. Sg. | βαρεῖ | βαρείᾳ | βαρεῖ |
| Acc. Sg. | βαρύν | βαρεῖαν | βαρύ |
| Nom. Pl. | βαρεῖς | βαρεῖαι | βαρέα |
| Gen. Pl. | βαρέων | βαρειῶν | βαρέων |
| Dat. Pl. | βαρέσι(ν) | βαρείαις | βαρέσι(ν) |
| Acc. Pl. | βαρεῖς | βαρείας | βαρέα |

This paradigm can be applied to ἡδύς in the Unit Vocabulary as well.

### -ης, -ες Adjectives

Two-termination consonant-declension adjectives with a dictionary entry in **-ης, -ες** will have declension patterns that look similar to those of [sigma-stem nouns](variable-stem-nouns#sigma-stem-nouns-1). That is because in these adjectives, there is an intervocalic sigma that drops out between an epsilon in the adjective stem and the vowels of the endings, as in sigma-stem nouns.

Take for example the adjective **ἀληθής, ἀληθές - true**. Like any two-termination adjective, the first form (ἀληθής) is used for both masculine and feminine forms, while the second form (ἀληθές) is used for neuter forms. Both are built on the stem ἀληθε(σ)-, and the masculine/feminine forms will decline like τριήρης while the neuter forms will decline like γένος.

Thus, when we see a form like ἀληθοῦς, the ending -ους obscures the original ending -ε(σ)ος, the ending -η obscures the original ending -ε(σ)α, etc. Make sure to check out [sigma-stem nouns](variable-stem-nouns#sigma-stem-nouns-1) for the specific explanation of each of these endings.

| | Masc./Fem. | Neuter |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | ἀληθής | ἀληθές |
| Gen. Sg. | ἀληθοῦς | ἀληθοῦς |
| Dat. Sg. | ἀληθεῖ | ἀληθεῖ |
| Acc. Sg. | ἀληθῆ | ἀληθές |
| Nom. Pl. | ἀληθεῖς | ἀληθῆ |
| Gen. Pl. | ἀληθῶν | ἀληθῶν |
| Dat. Pl. | ἀληθέσι(ν) | ἀληθέσι(ν) |

## Numerals

One major kind of adjective in ancient Greek is *numerals* or numbers. There are two kinds of numerals: **cardinal** (or **c**ounting) numbers, like "one" and "two", and **ordinal** (or **ord**ering) numbers, like "first" or "second."

As adjectives, numerals of either kind have to match the noun that they describe in gender, case, and number by declining the numeral. With this mind, we can split numerals into three declension patterns.

***

### 1) Cardinal Numbers 1-4

The cardinal numbers from one through four follow various declension patterns.

#### One (εἷς, μία, ἕν)
{: .no_toc }

The number **εἷς, μία, ἕν - one** is a 3-1-3 with a masculine/neuter stem in ἑν-. Note that it only exists in the singular (for, hopefully, self-evident reasons: the adjective literally means "one").

| | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | εἷς | μία | ἕν |
| Gen. Sg. | ἑνός | μίας | ἑνός |
| Dat. Sg. | ἑνί | μίᾳ | ἑνί |
| Acc. Sg. | ἑνά | μίαν | ἕν |

Note that if you prefix the forms of εἷς, μία, ἕν with the negation οὐδ(ε)-, you can form a pronoun that means "no one" (if masculine/feminine) or "nothing" (if neuter). It is also a pronominal adjective that can negate the noun that it modifies (e.g., οὐδεὶς ἀνήρ, "no man").

| | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | οὐδείς | οὐδεμία | οὐδέν |
| Gen. Sg. | οὐδενός | οὐδεμιᾶς | οὐδενός |
| Dat. Sg. | οὐδενί | οὐδεμιᾷ | οὐδενί |
| Acc. Sg. | οὐδένα | οὐδεμίαν | οὐδέν |

#### Two (δύο)
{: .no_toc }

The number **δύο - two** can either decline or remain **indeclinable**. An **indeclinable adjective** is one that does not change its endings or form, regardless of the gender, case, and number of the noun that it modifies. This means that the same form, δύο, can be used to indicate "two triremes" (δύο τριήρεις) or "two citizens" (δύο πολῖται).

| | Any Gender |
| ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Dual/Plural | δύο |
| Gen. Dual/Plural | δύο or δυοῖν |
| Dat. Dual/Plural | δύο or δυοῖν |
| Acc. Dual/Plural | δύο |

Note that the number two can be used either with a plural noun or with an actual dual noun.

#### Three (τρεῖς, τρία)
{: .no_toc }

The number **τρεῖς, τρία - three** is a two-termination consonant-declension adjective that declines in the plural similarly to πόλις.

| | Masc./Fem. | Neuter |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Pl. | τρεῖς | τρία |
| Gen. Pl. | τριῶν | τριῶν |
| Dat. Pl. | τρισί(ν) | τρισί(ν) |
| Acc. Pl. | τρεῖς | τρία |

#### Four (τέτταρες, τέτταρα)
{: .no_toc }

The number **τέτταρες, τέτταρα - four** is a two-termination consonant-declension adjective that declines in the plural with completely regular endings.

| | Masc./Fem. | Neuter |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Pl. | τέτταρες | τέτταρα |
| Gen. Pl. | τεττάρων | τεττάρων |
| Dat. Pl. | τέτταρσι(ν) | τέτταρσι(ν) |
| Acc. Pl. | τέτταρας | τέτταρα |

***

### 2) Cardinal Numbers 5 and Up

The cardinal numbers 5 and up are all **indeclinable**. This thankfully means that there are no new declension patterns to memorize; one adjective form may be used with whatever gender-case-number noun it modifies. For example:

* τὰς **πέντε** ναῦς εἴδομεν. We saw the **five** ships.
* τοὺς **πέντε** δικαστὰς εἴδομεν. We saw the **five** jurors.
* τὰ **πέντε** γέρα εἴδομεν. We saw the **five** gifts.

The Unit Vocabulary above contains the cardinal numbers up to 10.

***

### 3) Ordinal Numbers

All ordinal numbers are completely regular 2-1-2 (-ος, -α/-η, -ον) adjectives. The ordinal numbers "first", "second", and "third" are in the Unit Vocabulary and function just like any other adjective can.

* τὰ βιβλία ἐπὶ ταῖς ναυσὶ ταῖς **πρώταις** φέρεται. The books are being carried on the **first** ships.
* ὁ δεύτερος παῖς ἐστιν. He is the **second** child.
* ὁ διδάσκαλος εἶπε τοὺς τοῦ **τρίτου** ποιήματος λόγους. The teacher spoke the words of the **third** poem.
