## Interrogatives

This unit will introduce a new syntactic structure called **indirect questions**, but in order to understand how an indirect question works, we must first understand the types of words that can introduce them.

**Interrogative pronouns/adjectives, adverbs, or conjunctions** are words that introduce **questions** (from Latin *interrogare*, "to ask"). These include typical question words like "who? which? what?" and others that have adverbial flavors like "when? where? how? why?"

In Greek, the **interrogative pronoun/adjective** is **τίς, τί** (2-termination), meaning **"who? which? what?"** ("who" for masculine/feminine; "what" for neuter). It declines as follows:

| | Masc./Fem. | Neut. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | τίς | τί |
| Gen. Sg. | τίνος (τοῦ) | τίνος (τοῦ) |
| Dat. Sg. | τίνι (τῷ) | τίνι (τῷ) |
| Acc. Sg. | τίνα | τί |
| Nom. Pl. | τίνες | τίνα |
| Gen. Pl. | τίνων | τίνων |
| Dat. Pl. | τίσι(ν) | τίσι(ν) |
| Acc. Pl. | τίνας | τίνα |

Note that the accent on each of these forms is persistent and consistently acute (meaning that it will never flip to a grave, even if on the ultima of a word).

The **interrogative** thus can introduce a regular question that would lead off with those question words, either as a standalone pronoun or as an adjective that modifies an explicit noun in the sentence:

* **τίς** τοὺς ἵππους πρὸς τὴν θάλατταν ἄγει; **Who** is leading the horses toward the sea? (τίς = masc./fem. nom. sg., subject of ἄγει)
* **τί** ἐκεῖνος εἶπεν; **What** did that man say? (τί = neut. acc. sg., direct object of εἶπεν)
* **τίνας παῖδας** ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ εἶδες; **Which children** did you see in the house? (τίνας = masc./fem. acc. pl., modifying παῖδας)
* **τίνι** τὸ βιβλίον ἔδωκα; **To whom** did I give the book? (τίνι = masc./fem. dat. sg., indirect oject of ἔδωκα)
* **τίνος** ὅπλα ἔλαβον; **Whose** weapons did I take? (τίνος = masc./fem. gen. sg., possessor of ὅπλα; literally "I took the weapons **of whom**?")

Note that the **neuter accusative singular, τί**, is often used as an **adverbial accusative** that means **"why?"**:

* **τί** ταῦτα ἐποίησας; **Why** did you do these things?

There are also **interrogative adverbs** that ask questions that modify verbal actions as opposed to indicating or modifying actors in a sentence. For example:

* **πῶς** τούσδε τοὺς μαθητὰς ἐδίδαξεν; **How** did he teach these students?
* **πότε** ἦλθες; **When** did you come?
* **ποῦ** οἱ παῖδες ἦσαν; **Where** were the children?

### Indefinites

The interrogative pronoun, when accented as an [**enclitic**](../alphabet-and-accents#accent-positions-and-enclitics), fulfills a different function: that of an **indefinite pronoun/adjective**, which means "some" or "any" (or, as a substantive, "someone/anyone", "some/any people", "something/anything", "some/any things", in the appropriate genders and numbers). An **indefinite** word, as the name implies, makes a reference to no specific person, thing, time, place, etc.; it could be **some** or **any** instance of the person, thing, time, place, etc., in question.

The identification of an **indefinite pronoun/adjective** relies on its **accentuation** and, sometimes, position within a sentence, since (as we'll see) interrogatives do not necessarily need to be contained within a sentence that terminates with a question mark. With regard to accents, interrogatives will always have an acute or circumflex, while indefinites, because they are enclitics, will generally not have accents unless they are themselves followed by other enclitic words. With regard to position, interrogatives tend to begin their clauses, while indefinites do so more rarely. For example:

* εἶδόν **τι** ἐπὶ τῇ ὁδῷ. I saw **something** in the road. (indefinite, enclitic)
* **τί** εἶδον ἐπὶ τῇ ὁδῷ; **What** did I see in the road? (interrogative, with acute accent)
* ἔρχονταί **τινες** εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν. **Some people** are going into the house. (indefinite, enclitic)
* **τίνες** ἔρχονται εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν; **Who** are going into the house? (interrogative, with acute accent)

This distinction of **accented = interrogative; enclitic = indefinite** also applies to the **adverbs** used in the examples above; their **indefinite** counterparts make the time, method, place, etc., inherent in the word's definition indistinct. For example:

* τούσδε τοὺς μαθητας **πως** ἐδίδαξεν. He taught these students **somehow**. (indefinite method, enclitic)
* **πῶς** τούσδε τοὺς μαθητὰς ἐδίδαξεν; **How** did he teach these students? (interrogative, with circumflex accent)
* ἦλθές **ποτε**. You came **at some time** / **at some point**. (indefinite time, enclitic)
* **πότε** ἦλθες; **When** did you come? (interrogative, with acute accent)
* οἱ παῖδές **που** ἦσαν. The children were **somewhere**. (indefinite place, enclitic)
* **ποῦ** οἱ παῖδες ἦσαν; **Where** were the children? (interrogative, with circumflex accent)

## Indirect Questions

Each of the questions in the examples above is a **direct question**, meaning that the sentence itself asks something and is terminated with a question mark (;). If prefaced with an appropriate head verb (like "to ask", "to learn", etc.), these direct questions can become subordinate/dependent clauses known as **indirect questions**, defined here as questions introduced by a head verb.

The direct question will generally simply be tacked onto the end of the main clause that contains the head verb to form a declarative sentence (i.e., the sentence will end with a period or middle dot as opposed to a question mark, since it forms a statement rather than asking the question directly). Generally, the question itself will exhibit no changes between its direct and indirect forms, unless the dependent verb's person and number needs to change to fit the context better. There are also two other cases that will allow for changes that we'll discuss below. For example:

* ποῦ ἔρχῃ; Where are you going?
* ὁ διδάσκαλος ἐρωτᾷ **ποῦ ἔρχῃ**. The teacher is asking **where you are going**.
* ὁ διδάσκαλος ἐρωτᾷ **ποῦ ἔρχεται**. The teacher is asking **where she is going**.
* τί ὁ πολίτης ταῦτα εἶπεν; Why did the citizen say these things?
* ἔμαθον **τί ὁ πολίτης ταῦτα εἶπεν**. I learned **why the citizens said these things**.

For the first case referenced above, **indirect questions** are governed by the [**sequence of moods**](subj-opt-overview#sequence-of-moods), primarily when the sentence is in secondary sequence. This means that we can change the verb in the indirect question in the last example above into the optative with no change in meaning, just form.

* τί ὁ πολίτης ταῦτα εἶπεν; Why did the citizen say these things?
* ἔμαθον τί ὁ πολίτης ταῦτα **εἶπεν**. I learned why the citizens said these things.
* ἔμαθον τί ὁ πολίτης ταῦτα **εἴποι**. I learned why the citizen said these things.

Note that indirect questions introduced by one of the interrogative adverbs (ποῦ, πότε, πῶς) may substitute that adverb for an **indirect** form by prefixing the adverb with ὁ- (e.g., ὅπου, ὅποτε, ὅπως).

* ὁ διδάσκαλος ἐρωτᾷ **ὅπου ἔρχεται**. The teacher is asking **where she is going**.
* ὁ πολίτης ἠρώτησεν **ὅποτε αἱ νῆες ἔλθοιεν**. The citizen asked **when the ships had come**.

### Indirect Interrogative / Indefinite Relative

For the second case referenced above, an **indirect question** can use either the regular interrogative pronoun **τίς, τί** to begin the indirect question or an alternate pronoun called the **indirect interrogative**, named appropriately since it can be used in indirect (not direct) questions. The pronoun is a combination of the relative pronoun (ὅς, ἥ, ὅ) and the indefinite pronoun (τις, τι), with some alternatives in certain persons and numbers:

| | Masc. | Fem. | Neut. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | ὅστις | ἥτις | ὅ τι |
| Gen. Sg. | οὗτινος (ὅτου) | ἧστινος | οὗτινος (ὅτου) |
| Dat. Sg. | ᾧτινι (ὅτῳ) | ᾗτινι | ᾧτινι (ὅτῳ) |
| Acc. Sg. | ὅντινα | ἥντινα | ὅ τι |
| Nom. Pl. | οἵτινες | αἵτινες | ἅτινα (ἅττα) |
| Gen. Pl. | ὧντινων (ὅτων) | ὧντινων | ὧντινων (ὅτων) |
| Dat. Pl. | οἷστισι(ν) (ὅτοις) | αἷστισι(ν) | οἷστισι(ν) (ὅτοις) |
| Acc. Pl. | οὕστινας | ἅστινας | ἅτινα (ἅττα) |

Note that the **neuter nom./acc. singular, ὅ τι**, is usually spelled with a space in between the two elements to differentiate it from the conjunction ὅτι that we've used for indirect statements and superlative adjectives/adverbs.

Thus, if an indirect question is introduced by an interrogative pronoun, we can optionally swap in an indirect interrogative form with no discernable change in translation:

* ἠρώτησα **τίς** τοὺς ἵππους πρὸς τὴν θάλατταν ἄγει; I asked **who** is leading the horses toward the sea.
* ἠρώτησα **ὅστις** τοὺς ἵππους πρὸς τὴν θάλατταν ἄγει. I asked **who** is leading the horses toward the sea.
* ἠρώτησα **ὅστις** τοὺς ἵππους πρὸς τὴν θάλατταν **ἄγοι**. I asked **who** is leading the horses toward the sea. (sequence of moods)
* ἔμαθον **τί** ἐκεῖνος εἶπεν. I learned **what** that man said.
* ἔμαθον **ὅ τι** ἐκεῖνος εἶπεν. I learned **what** that man said.
* ἔμαθον **ὅ τι** ἐκεῖνος **εἴποι**. I learned **what** that man said. (sequence of moods)

This indirect interrogative pronoun also functions as an **indefinite relative pronoun**, which means "whoever", "whichever", or "whatever", in certain uses that we'll cover in the unit on conditionals.
