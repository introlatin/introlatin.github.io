## Dependent Uses of the Subjunctive

The following uses of the subjunctive are in **dependent clauses**, which means that they are clauses which need the context of a main verb in order to make sense. These dependent clauses that contain subjunctive verbs often function adverbially, to explain a circumstance or a reason behind the performance of the main verb, as we'll illustrate in a bit.

These dependent clauses will each be introduced by a **conjunction or pronoun** that will indicate that relationship between the dependent clause and the main clause.

Dependent clauses that contain the subjunctive are also governed by the [**sequence of moods**](subj-opt-overview#sequence-of-moods), wherein if the main verb is in a secondary tense, the subjunctive verb in the dependent clause can optionally be transformed into the optative, as we'll discuss more in depth once we learn about the formation of the optative in a later unit.

### Purpose Clauses

A **purpose clause** explains **the intention or purpose behind the action of the main verb**. Here's an English example:

* We are going into the city **so that we might/may see you all.**

The "so that" clause explains our purpose or intent in going to the city; we wanted to see you all. In this context, "we are going into the city" is the **main clause**, while "so that we might see you all" is the dependent **purpose clause**. "So that" is the conjunction that introduces the dependent clause, and the "might" or "may" in the verb comes from its subjunctive nature.

Note, however, that in English, a purpose clause can look deceptively like an *infinitive* if the **subject of the purpose clause** and the **subject of the main clause** are the **same**. For example, note that in the example sentence above, both "we are going" and "we might see" are first person plural. Thus, I can rewrite the sentence in the following ways:

* We are going into the city **in order to see you all.**
* We are going into the city **to see you all**.

Both of these sentences are functionally equivalent to their first iteration above, in which the purpose clause read "so that we might see you all." In English, they look like infinitives ("in order to see" or "to see"). **However, you cannot indicate a purpose clause using an infinitive in Greek as you can in English.**

In Greek, a **purpose clause** contains a subjunctive verb and can indicate either a positive intent or a negative intent, dependent on the conjunction and any associated negations that govern the clause:

* ἵνα, ὅπως, ὡς = positive purpose ("(so / in order) that; (in order) to")
* ἵνα μή, ὅπως μή, ὡς μή, μή = negative purpose ("(so / in order) that ... not; (in order) not to")

So, note the Greek translation(s) of the English example(s) above:

* We are going into the city **so that we might see you.**
    * ἐρχόμεθα εἰς τὴν πόλιν **ἵνα ὑμᾶς ἴδωμεν.**
    * ἐρχόμεθα εἰς τὴν πόλιν **ὅπως ὑμᾶς ἴδωμεν.**
    * ἐρχόμεθα εἰς τὴν πόλιν **ὡς ὑμᾶς ἴδωμεν.**

A negative purpose clause uses any of the positive conjunctions with the negation μή *or* simply μή as a conjunction itself:

* We are leaving the city **so that we might not see you** / **in order not to see you**.
    * λείπομεν τὴν πόλιν **ἵνα ὑμᾶς μὴ ἴδωμεν.**
    * λείπομεν τὴν πόλιν **ὅπως ὑμᾶς μὴ ἴδωμεν.**
    * λείπομεν τὴν πόλιν **ὡς ὑμᾶς μὴ ἴδωμεν.**
    * λείπομεν τὴν πόλιν **μὴ ὑμᾶς ἴδωμεν.**

Note that in the last example, **μή** serves as a full conjunction in its own right, rather than just a negation. Thus, the "so that ... not" or "in order not to" is taken care of entirely by μή, and we don't need any extra negations or conjunctions to fill out the negative purpose clause.

#### ὡς

It's worth noting that one of the conjunction options, ὡς, has been used in three other contexts before: [indirect statements](subordination/indirect-statement#ὅτι--ὡς), [result clauses](result-clauses), and [superlative adjectives/adverbs](../substantives-2/comp-and-superl#superlative-with-ὡς--ὅτι). The key to telling ὡς clauses apart is in the context of what precedes and follows the ὡς.

For example, if the main verb is a head verb (to say, to speak, to think, to know, etc.) and the ὡς clause contains an indicative verb, it's probably an **indirect statement**. If there is a οὕτως in the main clause and the ὡς clause contains an indicative verb, it's probably an **actual result clause**. If a superlative adjective or adverb immediately follows the ὡς, it's a **superlative use**. If the ὡς has a subjunctive verb after it, then it's probably a **purpose clause**.

* ὁ παῖς ἀγγέλλει **ὡς** ὑμᾶς εἴδομεν. The child announces that we saw you all. (indirect statement)
* ἀπὸ τῆς νέως οὕτως ἤλθετε **ὡς** ὑμᾶς εἴδομεν. You all came from the ship in such a way that we saw you all. (actual result clause)
* **ὡς** τάχιστα ἤλθετε. You all came as quickly as possible. (superlative)
* ἐρχόμεθα εἰς τὴν πόλιν **ὡς** ὑμᾶς ἴδωμεν. We are going into the city in order to see you all. (purpose clause)

#### Future Participle Indicating Purpose

We can also express purpose in Greek by using a **future participle** rather than a full subjunctive dependent clause. The participle will agree in gender, case, and number with the noun that has that purpose or intention in mind; often it will be the subject of the main verb.

* ἡμεῖς εἰς τὴν πόλιν ἐρχόμεθα **ὑμᾶς ὀψόμενοι**. We are going into the city **in order to see you all**.

The future middle participle ὀψόμενοι agrees with the subject ἡμεῖς in gender, case, and number (masculine nominative plural), indicating that it is *we* who intended to see you all.

### Fear Clauses

A **fear clause** explains the substance of a fear expressed in the main clause, i.e., what the person being afraid is actually afraid of, if they are afraid of something that **will/might happen** or that **could be presently happening but we're not entirely sure**. For example:

* I am afraid **that he will/might send the horses away**.

The "that" clause expresses a positive fear: I am afraid that the action of him sending the horses away will happen. For a **positive fear clause** like this, the conjunction that introduces the clause will, counterintuitively, be **μή**:

* φοβοῦμαι **μὴ τοὺς ἵππους ἀφῇ.** (ἀφῇ > 3rd sg. aor. act. subj. from ἀφίημι)

Do not be fooled by the presence of the **μή**: it is not a negation in this sentence, but rather, it's a conjunction that introduces a fear clause and is simply translated as "that."

A **negative fear clause** expresses a fear that something will *not* happen and uses the conjunction **μή οὐ**.

* φοβοῦμαι **μὴ ἐμὲ οὐ φιλῇς**. I am afraid **that you don't love me**.

Note that if the fear is more definite (e.g., the feared action happened in the past or it's definitely happening in the present), a fear clause can use an indicative verb.

* φοβοῦμαι **μὴ ἐμὲ οὐκ εἶδες.** I am afraid **that you didn't see me**.
