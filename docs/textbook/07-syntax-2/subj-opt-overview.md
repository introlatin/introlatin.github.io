## Subjunctive and Optative Overview

**Finite verbs**, defined as verbs with a **person and number**, can exhibit one of four moods, only one of which we have discussed so far:

* indicative
* imperative
* subjunctive
* optative

Every finite verb form that we've encountered so far has been in the **indicative** mood. A verb's **mood** indicates the speaker's attitude regarding the verbal action. So, an **indicative** verb means that the speaker considers the verb's action factual or verifiable (e.g., "He **brought** the book to me."). The **imperative** mood means that the speaker considers the verbal action a command (e.g., "**Bring** the book to me!").

The **subjunctive and optative moods** deal with verbal actions that are less definite:
* The **subjunctive** means that the speaker considers the action may happen happen or is more hypothetical than the indicative, i.e., the verbal action hasn't yet happened, isn't now happening, or won't happen definitely or verifiably.
* The **optative** means that the speaker considers the action to be a wish or to be even more hypothetical or less definite than the subjunctive.

Both the subjunctive and the optative occur in the **present, aorist, and (more rarely) perfect tenses**, while the optative alone and very rarely can also occur in the **future tense**. Tenses in the subjunctive and the optative almost always indicate **aspect** rather than absolute time, similar to the way in which tenses in infinitives and participles work. For a review of how aspect works, check out [Verbal Aspect](../infs-and-parts/infinitive-uses#verbal-aspect) in the Infinitive Uses unit.

## Sequence of Moods

Both the subjunctive and the optative can be used either as the main verbs in **independent clauses** or, more commonly, as the verbs in **dependent clauses**. In the latter case, there is a concept called the **sequence of moods** that governs whether you use the subjunctive or the optative in a dependent clause; the choice depends on the **tense of the verb in the main clause**.

| Tense of Main Verb | Mood of Dependent Verb |
| ----- | ----- |
| Primary (present, future, perfect, future perfect | Subjunctive |
| Secondary (imperfect, aorist, pluperfect) | Subjunctive or Optative |

A sentence that contains a main verb in a primary tense is **in primary sequence**, while a sentence that contains a main verb in a secondary tense is **in secondary sequence**.

The sequence of moods mostly governs dependent clauses in which we would expect a subjunctive, as we'll discuss in later units (e.g., purpose clauses and fear clauses). However, some types of dependent clauses that we've already learned about can optionally swap in an optative in secondary sequence (e.g., indirect statements following ὅτι / ὡς); more on this in the unit on uses of the optative.
