## Sequence of Moods

In addition to independent clauses, as discussed in the [previous unit](indep-opt), the **optative** can also be used in **dependent clauses** (i.e., clauses that are introduced by a subordinating conjunction or pronoun). We luckily already know how to identify most of the dependent clauses in which we can use an optative verb because of the **sequence of moods**, which will apply to **purpose clauses**, **fear clauses**, and **indirect statements using ὅτι/ὡς**. Other dependent uses of the optative, including indirect questions and conditions, will be discussed in later units.

Recall that the **sequence of moods** determines whether you can use a subjunctive or an optative verb within a dependent clause depending on the tense of the main verb:

| Tense of Main Verb | Mood of Dependent Verb |
| ----- | ----- |
| Primary (present, future, perfect, future perfect | Subjunctive |
| Secondary (imperfect, aorist, pluperfect) | Subjunctive or Optative |

## Optative Substitutions

As indicated above, we can use an optative verb in the following types of dependent clauses if the main verb of the sentence in question is in a secondary tense:

* purpose clauses
* fear clauses
* indirect statements with ὅτι / ὡς

Of these, the first two expect a subjunctive verb in the dependent clause, while the third expects an indicative verb. In all three cases, however, if the main verb is in a past tense, then the verb within the dependent clause can be an **optative of the same tense and voice as the original verb**.

For example:

* **ἔρχομεθα** εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν ἵνα ὑμᾶς **ἴδωμεν**. We **are coming** into the house in order to see you.

This sentence contains a **purpose clause** with a subjunctive verb, ἵνα ὑμᾶς ἴδωμεν, which depends on the main verb ἔρχομεθα, which is in a primary tense. If we were to change the tense of that main verb into a past tense, we could retain the subjunctive if we wanted, according to the sequence of moods:

* **ἤλθομεν** εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν ἵνα ὑμᾶς **ἴδωμεν**. We **came** into the house in order to see you.

We may also optionally change the subjunctive verb into the **optative of the same tense and voice**, with no difference in translation or meaning:

* **ἤλθομεν** εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν ἵνα ὑμᾶς **ἴδοιμεν**. We came into the house in order to see you.

We can do the same thing with **fear clauses**:

* ὁ διδάσκαλος **φοβεῖται** μὴ οἱ μαθηταὶ τὰ βιβλία οὐκ **φέρωσιν**. The teacher **is afraid** that the students might not bring their books.

If the main verb φοβεῖται is transformed into a secondary tense, we can either retain the subjunctive φέρωσιν or substitute in an optative of the same tense and voice:

* ὁ διδάσκαλος **ἐφοβεῖτο** μὴ οἱ μαθηταὶ τὰ βιβλία οὐκ **φέρωσιν**. The teacher **was afraid** that the students might not bring their books.
* ὁ διδάσκαλος **ἐφοβεῖτο** μὴ οἱ μαθηταὶ τὰ βιβλία οὐκ **φέροιεν**. The teacher **was afraid** that the students might not bring their books.

The last type of substitution, with **indirect statements using ὅτι / ὡς** in secondary sequence, involves similar transformations, keeping in mind that transforming an **indicative** into an **optative** may involve extra steps, like unaugmenting a stem.

* ὁ πολίτης **ἀγγέλλει** ὅτι ἡ ναῦς πολλοὺς ἵππους **ἤνεγκεν**. The citizen **announces** that the ship carried many horses.
* ὁ πολίτης **ἤγγειλεν** ὅτι ἡ ναῦς πολλοὺς ἵππους **ἤνεγκεν**. The citizen **announced** that the ship carried many horses.
* ὁ πολίτης **ἤγγειλεν** ὅτι ἡ ναῦς πολλοὺς ἵππους **ἐνέγκοι**. The citizen **announced** that the ship carried many horses.

It is in **indirect statements in secondary sequence** that we see the rare **future optative** being used. This occurs if the direct version of the statement would have used a future tense verb. For example:

* ὁ στρατὸς καταβήσεται (3rd sg. fut. mid. ind. of καταβαίνω). The army will march down to the sea.
* ὁ πολίτης μανθάνει **ὅτι ὁ στρατὸς καταβήσεται**. The citizen learns that the army will march down to the sea.
* ὁ πολίτης **ἔμαθεν** ὅτι ὁ στρατὸς **καταβήσοιτο** The citizen learned that the army would march down to the sea.
