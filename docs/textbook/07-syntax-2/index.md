# Substantives and Adjectives 2

This module introduces new material relating to sentence syntax in ancient Greek that builds upon the foundational knowledge that we began learning about in the first semester. Topics for this module include result clauses, the sequence of moods, uses of the subjunctive, uses of the optative, indirect questions, and conditions.
