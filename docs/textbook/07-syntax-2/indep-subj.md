## Independent versus Dependent Clauses

A **clause** is a series of words that can communicate an idea, often centered around a **finite verb**. As we've seen, there are two major kinds of clauses: **independent clauses**, which stand on their own and communicate a complete thought; and **dependent clauses**, which are introduced by a subordinating conjunction or pronoun and require the context of a **main clause** in order to make sense. For example:

* independent: He stands near the house.
* dependent: Because he stands near the house... (we're left wondering what happens as a result of his standing near the house, which can be communicated by a main clause)

This unit explores the ways in which the **subjunctive** can be used in **independent clauses**. Dependent clauses that use the subjunctive will be introduced in the next unit.

Recall that the **tenses of subjunctive verbs** indicate **aspect** rather than absolute time, so a present subjunctive and an aorist subjunctive can refer to the same moment in time; the difference is whether the action is continuous or ongoing (present aspect) or instantaneous or completed (aorist aspect).

Also, since the subjunctive deals in the realm of non-factual circumstances, the negation for these independent uses of the subjunctive will be **μή** and its associated forms (μηδέ, μήτε, and μηδείς), rather than οὐ and its associated forms, which are used for factual, indicative circumstances.

## Independent Uses

The following uses of the subjunctive are in independent clauses, meaning that these sentences stand on their own and do not need to be introduced by special conjunctions or pronouns.

### Hortatory Subjunctive

A **hortatory subjunctive** issues a **first-person** command. Most often, it will be a **first person plural** verb in the subjunctive that **exhorts** the group to do something. For example:

* **λάβωμεν** τὰ ὅπλα. **Let us take** the weapons.

The most straightforward translation for a hortatory subjunctive is **"let us [verb]"**, for which reason a funny alternative name for the hortatory subjunctive is the "salad" subjunctive ("let us" = "lettuce").

* τὰ βιβλία τοῖς διδασκάλοις μὴ **δῶμεν**. Let us not give the books to the teachers.
* * **ἴδωμεν** τὰς μεγάλας ναῦς. Let us see the big ships.

### Prohibitive Subjunctive

A **prohibitive subjunctive** issues a negative command in the **2nd or 3rd person**, using the negation **μή**: **"don't [verb]" or "let [subject] not [verb]."** For example:

* **μὴ ποιήσῃς** τὰ ἄδικα. Don't do the unjust things.
* ὁ παῖς **μὴ εἴπῃ** ἐκείνους τοὺς λόγους. Let the child not say those words.

Note as well that the negation includes associated forms as well:

* μηδεὶς τοῖς ἀδίκοις λέγῃ. Let no one speak to the unjust ones.

The difference between a prohibitive subjunctive and a negative hortatory subjunctive is the **person** of the verb: prohibitive subjunctives are 2nd or 3rd person, while hortatory subjunctives are first person.

***

### Deliberative Subjunctive

A **deliberative subjunctive** expresses a question wherein the speaker is *deliberating* in a course of action: "should...?". As a result, many deliberative subjunctives are in the first person.

* τῷδε πείθωμαι; Should I obey this person?
* τοῦ διδασκάλου ἀκούσωμεν; Should we listen to the teacher?

The clearest tell for a deliberative subjunctive is the presence of a question mark (;) at the end of the sentence.

* τοὺς ἵππους παρὰ τὴν οἰκίαν ἱστῶμεν; Should we make the horses stand near the house?
* τοὺς ἵππους παρὰ τὴν οἰκίαν ἱστῶμεν. Let us make the horses stand near the house.
