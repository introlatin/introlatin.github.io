## Independent Uses of the Optative

Like the subjunctive, the **optative** can be used as the finite verb for either **independent clauses** or **dependent clauses**. This unit tackles the former in two major independent uses: the **potential optative** and **future wishes**. The latter will also include a discussion of wishes that cannot be fulfilled (i.e., unattainable wishes, that can occur either in the present or the past).

Recall that the tense of the optative indicates **aspect** rather than absolute time, such that the use of, e.g., a present optative will indicate continuous or incomplete action while an aorist optative will indicate instantaneous or completed action.

## Potential Optative

A **potential optative** expresses an event that **may or might** occur in the future; thus, it has the *potential* to happen, but it is neither happening currently nor did it happen in the past.

This use of the optative is often signalled by the presence of the particle **ἄν** somewhere in the sentence. The particle itself is not translated, but it signals the unreal nature of the verb's action (unreal in the sense that it didn't happen yet or isn't happening right now but it may or might happen in the future). So, for example:

* **ἀγάγοιμεν ἂν** τοὺς ἵππους ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ. **We might lead** the horses away from the road.
* ὁ πολίτης τὰ ὅπλα τοῖς δικαίοις **ἂν δοίη**. The citizen **may give** the weapons to the just people.

To negate a potential optative, we use, uncharacteristically, the negation **οὐ** and its associated forms. While we would expect μή, which is used for most non-factual circumstances, the potential optative is an outlier in this regard.

* **οὐκ** ἂν ὁρῷς τὰ βιβλία ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ. You might **not** see the books in the house.

## Wishes

There are two types of wishes in ancient Greek:
* **future wishes** that expresses a hope that something might happen in the future. For example: "If only the ship would come!"
* **unattainable wishes** that express a desire that cannot be accomplished. There are two types:
    * a **present unattainable wish** that expresses a desire for something to be happening now, but it is not happening. For example: "If only the cavalrymen were here!" [The implication is that the cavalrymen are not in fact here at the present moment, and the wish is thus unattainable.]
    * a **past unattainable wish** that expresses a desire for something to have happened in the past, but it did not happen. For example: "If only I had seen you!" [The implication is that I did not in fact see you in the past, and the wish is thus unattainable].

Each type of wish will use a different verb mood, as we'll explore below.

Both types of wishes are generally, though not always, signaled by a particle like **εἴθε** or **εἰ γάρ**. They can also be negated, to indicate a desire that something not happen, using the negation **μή**.

### Future Wishes

**Future wishes** use the **optative mood** and are generally translated: **"If only ... would/might [verb]"**. Another more archaic translation is: **"Would that ... [verb]"**. For example:

* εἴθε σὲ παρὰ τὴν οἰκίαν ἴδοιμι. If only I might see you near the house!
* εἰ γὰρ ἡ ναῦς ἔλθοι. Would that the ship come!

Negations of future wishes generally use the negation μή:

* μὴ ὁ διδάσκαλος ἐμὲ ἴδοι. If only the teacher would not see me!

### Unattainable Wishes

**Unattainable wishes** use the **indicative mood**, strangely enough, and the tense and translation used depends on the type of unattainable wish. The negation will be **μή** in both circumstances, and often, the presence of the non-factual **μή** will be your clue that you're dealing with an unattainable wish, rather than a straightforward use of the indicative mood.

**Present unattainable wishes** use the **imperfect indicative** and are generally translated as: **"If only ... were [verb]ing"**. For example:

* εἴθε οἱ ἱππεῖς ἤρχοντο. If only the cavalrymen were coming. [But they're not.]
* εἰ γὰρ τοὺς μαθητὰς ἀφίεις. If only you were sending the students away. [But you're not.]
* μὴ ὁ πολίτης ἔλεγεν. If only the citizen weren't speaking. [But he is.]

Compare the last example, which uses the non-factual negation μή, with the following:

* ὁ πολίτης οὐκ ἔλεγεν. The citizen was not speaking.

In this sentence, the factual negation οὐ clues us into the fact that this is a simple declarative statement, versus the non-factual negation μή, which indicates that the statement is an unattainable wish.

**Past unattainable wishes** use the **aorist indicative** and are generally translated as: **"If only ... had [verb]ed"**. For example:

* εἴθε οἱ ἱππεῖς ἦλθον. If only the cavalrymen had come. [But they didn't.]
* εἰ γὰρ τοὺς μαθητὰς ἀφῆκας. If only you had sent the students away. [But you didn't.]
* μὴ ὁ πολίτης εἶπεν. If only the citizen hadn't spoken. [But he did.]

#### ὀφείλω

**Unattainable wishes** can also be constructed using a special verb and a complementary infinitive. The verb in question is **ὀφείλω**, which at its core means "to owe" or imply that something should be happening or should have happened.

Specifically, we can use the **second aorist** of ὀφείλω (ὤφελον) in the appropriate **person and number** for the subject of the wished action, and that action itself will be a **complementary infinitive**: **present tense** for **present unattainable wishes**, and **aorist tense** for **past unattainable wishes**. Thus, we can rewrite the examples above as follows (with the conjugated verb version juxtaposed for comparison):

* If only the cavalrymen were coming!
    * εἴθε οἱ ἱππεῖς ἤρχοντο.
    * ὤφελον ἔρχεσθαι οἱ ἱππεῖς.
* If only the cavalrymen had come!
    * εἴθε οἱ ἱππεῖς ἦλθον.
    * ὤφελον ἐλθεῖν οἱ ἱππεῖς.

* If only you were sending the students away!
    * εἰ γὰρ τοὺς μαθητὰς ἀφίεις.
    * ὤφελες ἀφιέναι τοὺς μαθητάς. [Note that the 2nd person singular "you" is indicated with the verb ὤφελες.]
* If only you had sent the students away!
    * εἰ γὰρ τοὺς μαθητὰς ἀφῆκας.
    * ὤφελες ἀφεῖναι τοὺς μαθητάς.

* If only the citizen weren't speaking!
    * μὴ ὁ πολίτης ἔλεγεν.
    * μὴ ὤφελεν ὁ πολίτης λέγειν.
* If only the citizen hadn't spoken!
    * εἰ γὰρ τοὺς μαθητὰς ἀφῆκας.
    * μὴ ὤφελεν ὁ πολίτης εἰπεῖν.
