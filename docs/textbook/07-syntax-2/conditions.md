## Conditions

**Conditions** or **conditionals** are **if/then statements**, wherein a condition is laid out for the performance of a verbal action. For example:

* If you ever say this, [then] you are right.
* If I study for the test, [then] I will get a good grade.
* If he were here, [then] he would see what is happening.

The condition is put forth by the "if" clause, and if the condition is met, then the action in the "then" clause gets performed. Note that the "then" in the main clause is most often understood, rather than explicitly stated in the sentence (hence the brackets in the examples above).

The **if clause** is called the **protasis** ("stretching forward", πρό + τείνω), and it is the **dependent clause**. In Greek, "if" is rendered with the conjunction **εἰ**. If negated, the protasis will use the negation **μή** (and the "if ... not" of the protasis can also be translated as "unless".)

The **then clause** (whether the "then" is explicitly stated or not) is called the **apodosis** ("giving back", ἀπό + δίδωμι), and it is the **main clause**. If negated, the apodosis will use the negation **οὐ**.

Conditions may also contain the generalizing / non-factual particle **ἄν** in either the protasis or the apodosis, depending on the kind of condition being depicted. This **ἄν** may also combine with conjunctions that introduce the protasis. For example, **εἰ** + **ἄν** results in the conjunction **ἐάν**, which is used in some condition types.

The most simple type of condition simply uses indicative verbs in both the protasis and the apodosis, with no extra particles or complications. This is called a **simple condition**. For example:

* εἰ ἐμὲ ὁρᾷς, παρὰ σὲ ἵσταμαι. If you see me, I am standing near you.

However, simple conditions are relatively rare in comparison to several types of condition that will use various verb moods and tenses to indicate different things about whether the condition is a general truth, whether the condition will or might occur in the future, or whether the condition was actually met or not. Thus, outside of simple conditions, there are six major types of conditions, grouped into three categories, that we will discuss over the next few sections:

* general conditions that express timeless, indefinite, customary truths
  * **present general**
  * **past general**
* future conditions that indicate that a condition may or may not be met at a later point in time
  * **future more vivid**
  * **future less vivid**
* contrary-to-fact or contrafactual conditions that indicate that a condition is not currently being met or has not been met, and so the action of the apodosis isn't happening or didn't happen
  * **past contrary-to-fact**
  * **present contrary-to-fact**

In order to determine which of the six conditions an if-then statement is, we have to determine the **tense and mood of both verbs in the condition**, as well as any **conjunctions or particles** that help govern the sentence. We'll discuss each of the possible combinations throughout the following sections.

### General Conditions

**General conditions** indicate timeless, indefinite, repeated, or customary truths in the past or present. They express conditions that don't refer to any specific instances; these are just the types of actions that generally happen if a condition is met. As a result, the translation of the protasis of general conditions will often include the generalizing adverb "ever", even if there is no corresponding term for it in Greek.

A general condition can occur either now or in the past; thus, the two types of general condition are **present general** and **past general**:

* If you [ever] hear those words, you are lucky. (present general)
* If you [ever] heard those words, you were lucky. (past general)

The determination of which kind of condition is being used depends on the verb tense and mood in both the protasis and the apodosis *and* the presence or absence of ἄν:

| Condition Type | Protasis ("if") | Apodosis ("then") |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| present general | ἐάν + subjunctive ("[ever]") | present indicative |
| past general | εἰ + optative ("[ever]") | imperfect indicative |

Note that the protasis in both conditions uses the aspectual moods (subjunctive and optative) while the apodosis uses the indicative. The tenses also affect the choice: note how in a past general condition, the verb of the protasis is expected to be in the optative, since the main verb (imperfect indicative) is in secondary sequence. Another distinction is that the present general includes ἄν in the protasis (in the conjunction ἐάν), while the past general protasis does not.

Here's what the **present general** condition looks like in Greek:

* ἐὰν ἀκούῃς ἐκείνους τοὺς λόγους, εὐτυχὴς εἶ. If you [ever] hear those words, you are lucky.

And here's what the **past general** condition looks like in Greek:

* εἰ ἀκούοις ἐκείνους τοὺς λόγους, εὐτυχὴς ἦσθα. If you [ever] heard those words, you were lucky.

Note that in both types, all the verbs, despite their moods, are translated as straightforward indicatives (present tense for both verbs in the present general, past tense for both verbs in the past general). This is necessary to ensure that we don't confuse general conditions with other types of conditions that may use auxiliary verbs like "would" or "should." General conditions simply express indefinite truths, while other types of conditions will handle actions that should, will, or would (have) happen(ed).

### Future Conditions

A **future** condition indicates an action that will or would happen in the future if the condition stipulated in the protasis is met. There are two levels of certainty as to whether the action will occur, indicated by the use of particular verb tenses and moods and particles:
* **future more vivid**, wherein the condition is almost certainly going to be met, and the future action is almost certainly going to be performed;
* and **future less vivid**, wherein that outcome is less certain.

| Condition Type | Protasis ("if") | Protasis Verb Translation | Apodosis ("then") | Apodosis Verb Translation |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| future more vivid | ἐάν + subjunctive | "[will] [verb]" | future indicative | "will [verb]" |
| future less vivid ("should/would") | εἰ + optative | "**should** [verb]" | optative + ἄν | "**would** [verb]" |

Note that the *protases* of future conditions look exactly similar to those of general conditions, in that all use the aspectual moods (the subjunctive and the optative) and the future more vivid uses the ἄν version of εἰ (ἐάν). The difference between future conditions and general conditions thus lies in the fact that the **apodoses** use the **future indicative in the future more vivid** and the **optative plus ἄν in the future less vivid**. Compare this against general conditions, which use the present indicative in the present general and the imperfect indicative (without ἄν) in the past general.

Here is an example of the **future more vivid**:

* **ἐὰν** εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν **ἔλθητε**, τὸν παῖδα **ὄψεσθε**. If you (will) go into the house, you will see the child.

Notice that in the protasis, the "will" of the translation is optional in English, even though this makes the English verb sound like a present tense ("If you **go** into the house...").

Again, you must consider both the protasis *and* the apodosis and the verb that each contains to determine what kind of condition you are doing with. We could have a present general condition that looks like the following:

* **ἐὰν** εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν **ἔλθητε**, τὸν παῖδα **ὁρᾶτε**. If you (ever) go into the house, you see the child. (present general)

This present general condition uses the exact same construction in its protasis as the future more vivid example above; the different lies in the apodoses. The present general condition states a general truth with no specific time period in mind (the child is going to be there; you see them whenever you go into the house) and uses a present indicative verb in the apodosis, while the future more vivid condition looks forward in time (if you go into the house later, you will see the child at that later point in time) and uses a future indicative verb in its apodosis.

Now, here is an example of the **future less vivid**:

* **εἰ** εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν **ἔλθοιτε**, τὸν παῖδα **ἂν ἴδοιτε**. If you **should** go into the house, you **would** see the child.

The future less vivid condition indicates that the performance of both the condition and the resulting action if it's met are less certain, as indicated by the "should-would" translation. This also contrasts against the past general condition, which shares a similar construction in Greek for its protasis (though a different translation) but a different construction for its apodosis:

* **εἰ** εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν **ἔλθοιτε**, τὸν παῖδα **ἑωρᾶτε**. If you went into the house, you saw / used to see the child. (past general)

It is only after you consider both the protasis *and* the apodosis that you can determine how to translate each, according to which kind of condition you're dealing with.

### Contrary-to-Fact Conditions

**Contrary-to-fact** or **contrafactual** conditions deal with actions in present or past time that would have occurred if a condition had been met -- however, the condition was not met, and thus the action did not happen (hence, "contrary to fact", i.e., it didn't happen or it isn't happening). Like the other conditions, contrary-to-fact conditions comprise two main types:
* **present contrary-to-fact**, which deals with events that **would** be happening now, but they aren't because a condition is not being met;
* and **past contrary-to-fact**, which deals with events that **would have** happened in the past, but they didn't because a condition was not met.

| Condition Type | Protasis ("if") | Protasis Verb Translation | Apodosis ("then") | Apodosis Verb Translation |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| present contrary-to-fact ("were/would") | εἰ + imperfect indicative | "were [verb]ing, were to [verb]" | imperfect indicative + ἄν | "would [verb]" |
| past contrary-to-fact ("had/would have") | εἰ + aorist indicative | "**had** [verb]ed" | aorist indicative + ἄν | "**would have** [verb]ed" |

Note that both of these conditions use the same tense and mood in the protasis and the apodosis (imperfect indicative for present C-to-F and aorist indicative for past C-to-F), while both apodoses use the generalizing / non-factual particle ἄν. While this helps us differentiate C-to-F conditions from general or future conditions, we run the risk of translating incorrectly if we don't identify those other markers of the condition, the conjunction εἰ or the particle ἄν. Both conditions are strictly governed by the translations "were/would" for present C-to-F and "had/would have" for past C-to-F, and if we aren't aware that we're dealing with a condition, we may default to regular translations of the imperfect and aorist indicative.

Here is an example of a **present contrary-to-fact**:

* **εἰ** εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν **ἤρχεσθε**, τὸν παῖδα **ἑωρᾶτε ἄν**. **If** you **were going** into the house, you **would see** the child.

If the condition of you going into the house were being met (i.e., if you were actually entering the house), then you would see the child. The construction of the condition, present contrary-to-fact, however, indicates that you're not actually going into the house; thus you don't see the child -- that action is *contrary to fact* in that it's not happening.

Here is an example of a **past contrary-to-fact**:

* **εἰ** εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν **ἤλθετε**, τὸν παῖδα **εἴδετε ἄν**. **If** you **had gone** into the house, you **would have seen** the child.

The use of the aorist tense in both clauses shifts the contrafactual situation to a point in the past; the condition of going into the house had not been met, so you did not see the child (in the past).

## Notes on All Types of Conditions

Be aware that not all conditions have to follow the pattern of protasis then apodosis; often, the apodosis may precede the protasis, or the protasis may even be woven into the apodosis, separated only by commas or common sense. For example:

* οὐχ ὁρᾷς τὸν παῖδα ἐὰν ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ μὴ ᾖς. You do not see the child if you are not in the house. / You do not see the child unless you are in the house. (present general)
* ὁ μαθητὴς πολλὰ βιβλία λήψεται ἐὰν πρῶτος ἔλθῃ. The student will take many books if he arrives first. (future more vivid)
* οἱ ἵπποι, εἰ ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ ἤχθησαν, παρὰ τὴν οἰκίαν ἂν ἔστησαν. The horses, if they had been led away from the road, would have stood near the house. (past contrary-to-fact)

As such, it is **essential** that you identify where a protasis begins (always at **εἰ** or **ἐάν**) and ends (usually at a punctuation mark or the end of the sense unit, e.g., at the first conjugated verb after the εἰ / ἐάν) in order to separate it forcefully from the apodosis. Each part of each type of condition has strict translation rules, and mixing up your "if" and "then" clauses will lead to a lot of confusion.

This is all the more important when considering that an apodosis may contain other constructions that we've learned, including hortatory subjunctives:

* ἐὰν ταῦτα λέγῃς, ἀκούσωμεν. If you will say these things, let us listen. (protasis of a future more vivid condition; hortatory subjunctive as the apodosis).

## Summary of Condition Types

In summary, here are the six types of conditions and their appropriate conjunctions, particles, and verb tenses and moods. Memorization of this table or at least the ability to reference it quickly will prove useful in the long run.

| Condition Type | Protasis ("if") | Apodosis ("then") |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| present general | ἐάν + subjunctive ("[ever]") | present indicative |
| past general | εἰ + optative ("[ever]") | imperfect indicative |
| future more vivid | ἐάν + subjunctive ("[will] [verb]") | future indicative ("will [verb]") |
| future less vivid ("should/would") | εἰ + optative ("**should** [verb]") | optative + ἄν ("**would** [verb]") |
| present contrary-to-fact ("were/would") | εἰ + imperfect indicative ("were [verb]ing, were to [verb]") | imperfect indicative + ἄν ("would [verb]") |
| past contrary-to-fact ("had/would have") | εἰ + aorist indicative ("**had** [verb]ed") | aorist indicative + ἄν ("**would have** [verb]ed") |

## Alternative Conditions

The same rules and classifications listed above may also apply to complex sentences with dependent clauses introduced by other words besides εἰ. These sentences form alternative conditions, in the sense that the same rules about verb tense and mood and the particle ἄν apply, but the "protasis" gets replaced by a **relative clause** (introduced by a special version of the relative pronoun called the *indefinite relative*) or a **temporal clause** (i.e., a time clause introduced by "when" or "whenever").

### Relative Conditions

**Relative conditions** replace the εἰ of a condition with the pronoun **ὅστις, ἥτις, ὅ τι**, in the appropriate gender, number, and case for the pronoun's antecedent and its function within the dependent clause. We saw this pronoun when discussing [indirect questions](indirect-questions#indirect-interrogative--indefinite-relative) as an **indirect interrogative**, a replacement for the direct interrogative τίς; τί; in an indirect question. This same pronoun doubles as an **indefinite relative pronoun** which in the context of a relative condition means "whoever", "whichever", or "whatever", especially when paired with the particle ἄν.

Again, these alternative conditions follow the same rules regarding verb tenses and moods in the "protasis" and "apodosis" as well as the placement of the particle ἄν. Thus, we can substitute many of the conditions we learned about above with this relative clause, introduced by the indefinite relative. For example:

* ὅστις ἂν τὴν θάλατταν ἴδῃ εὐτυχής ἐστιν. Whoever sees the sea is lucky.

In this example, the dependent clause **ὅστις ἂν τὴν θάλατταν ἴδῃ** begins with the indefinite relative, includes the particle ἄν, and has a verb in the subjunctive mood (ἴδῃ). The indefinite relative ὅστις is masculine nominative singular, indicating that it refers to a person (by virtue of being masculine as opposed to neuter) and that it is the subject (by virtue of being nominative). This dependent clause hangs on the main clause **εὐτυχής ἐστιν**, which contains the present indicative verb ἐστίν. Thus, this sentence is formed according to the rules of the **present general** condition.

The ὅστις clause also serves as the *de facto* subject of the main clause: Who is lucky? *Whoever sees the sea* or *the one who sees the sea*. Because the relative clause refers to a noun of some sort, that noun can function within the context of the full main clause in whatever way nouns normally do (as subjects, objects, etc.). More examples of this below.

In keeping with the core of the sentence as a condition, you may optionally turn it into one if you maintain the indefiniteness of the pronoun. For example: "*If anyone* sees the sea, *he* is lucky."

* ὅ τι ἂν εἴπῃς ἀκουσθήσεται. Whatever you say will be heard. (If you say anything, it will be heard.)

This relative condition follows the rules of the **future more vivid**, with the indefinite relative ὅ τι (neuter accusative singular) replacing εἰ in the protasis and functioning as the dependent clause's direct object, and with a future indicative verb ἀκουσθήσεται in the apodosis. Note how the relative clause here serves as the subject of the future passive main verb.

* οἵτινες ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ ἐρχοίμεθα εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν ἀγάγοιμεν ἄν. Whoever should come from the road, we would lead into the house. (If any people should come from the road, we would lead them into the house. *OR* We would lead whoever should come from the road into the house. *OR* any other combination that maintains the integrity of dependent and main clause boundaries and the type of condition)

This relative condition follows the rules of the **future less vivid**, with the optative in both clauses and ἄν in the apodosis. Note how the protasis serves as an object for the verb in the main clause: who would we lead into the house? Whoever should come from the road.

We may also use the **indirect adverbs** that we learned about with [indirect questions](indirect-questions#indirect-questions), like ὅπου, ὅποτε, and ὅπως, in the same way as an indefinite relative and with a similar indefinite translation of "ever":

* ὅπου ἂν ἔλθῃς, πολλὰ ὄψῃ. Wherever you (will) go, you will see many things.

### Temporal Conditions

We can also create **temporal conditions** by using a time conjunction like **ὅτε** ("when") or **ἐπεί / ἐπειδή** ("when", "after", "since") rather than εἰ or ὅστις. If the protasis uses ἄν, it will often combine with these conjunctions to form **ὅταν**, **ἐπήν**, and **ἐπειδάν** respectively.

* ὅταν ὁ ἵππος ἔλθῃ, ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ ἄξεις. Whenever the horse comes, you will lead (the horse) away from the road. (If the horse ever comes, you will lead [the horse] away from the road.)(future more vivid)
* ἀκούω ἐπειδὰν ὁ παῖς λέγει. I listen whenever the child speaks. (I listen if the child ever speaks.) (present general)
