## Perfect Tense Overview

Compared to the other tenses that you've learned so far (aorist, present, imperfect, and future), the **perfect tense** is more rare, but it will be beneficial to know how to identify it in context and how to translate it.

The **perfect** tense, as discussed [in the verb overview](overview#verb-aspects), indicates an action that occured in the past but has lasting effects into the present. This idea constitutes the third of the three verb **aspects**:

* present aspect: continuous, ongoing, incomplete action
* aorist(ic) aspect: instantaneous, completed action
* **perfect(ive) aspect**: action with effects that last beyond the action's completion

An illustration of perfect aspect is the following example: "He **has been seen**." The act of being seen occurred in the past, but he is still in the state of having been seen in the present tense; he can't be *un*seen.

Thus, the **perfect tense** is best expressed in English using **the auxiliary verb "has/have" with the past participle of the verb**, e.g. "has died", "have seen", "has spoken", "have wanted."

Like the other tenses that you already know, the perfect tense can be expressed in any of the three voices. For example:

* active: "They have ordered"
* middle: "They have ordered (for themselves)"
* passive: "They have been ordered"

The perfect tense will also complete our knowledge of the **principal parts**. The **fourth principal part** is used to conjugate the **perfect active** and also form its infinitive and participles. The **fifth principal part** is used to conjugate the **perfect middle and passive** and also form its infinitive and participles. Thus, the perfect operates similarly to the present tense: it has one form for **active** and one form for both **middle and passive**, so you will need to use context clues to figure out which voice your verb is.

### Reduplication and Perfect Tense Markers

Be aware that the tips and rules in this section are meant mainly to help you identify a perfect tense verb when you're looking at it. You will not be expected to memorize these rules or to generate a fourth or fifth principal part solely from looking at a first principal part, but being aware of reduplication and other perfect tense markers can help you identify a verb's meaning and form more easily.

The **perfect tense** in any voice will usually exhibit at least one tense marker: **reduplication**. Like an augment, **reduplication** affects the beginning of the verb stem, depending on the letter(s) that the verb stem begins with. However, unlike an augment, **reduplication cannot be removed or undone from a perfect tense stem**. This will be important when considering perfect infinitives, participles, and finite forms in the subjunctive or optative, especially since reduplication in some contexts can look like an augment.

There are four kinds of **reduplication**:

1) On most verbs that begin with a single consonant, reduplication involves **doubling the initial letter and adding -ε-**. Hence, notice the following transformations from a first principal part to a fourth and fifth:

* κελεύω > **κεκ**έλευκα, **κεκ**έλευσμαι
* δείκνυμι > **δέδ**ειχα, **δέδ**ειγμαι
* ποιέω > **πεπ**οίηκα, **πεπ**οίημαι

Note that if the single consonant is an aspirate (χ, φ, or θ), the reduplicated letter will be reduced to its non-aspirated form (χ -> κ, φ -> π, θ -> τ). For example, note from this unit's vocabulary:

* φεύγω -> **πέφ**ευγα

2) On verbs that begin with **the letters ζ, ρ, or a plosive + liquid or nasal combination** (see [consonant groups here](../basics/alphabet-and-accents#consonant-groups)), reduplication involves **adding an initial ε-**. Keep in mind, though, that this is ***not*** a syllabic augment that can be detached from a verb stem; it must remain when we are forming perfect infinitive, participle, subjunctive, optative, and imperative forms. For example:

* ζηλόω -> **ἐζ**ήλωκα, **ἐζ**ήλωμαι
* ῥίπτω -> **ἔρρ**ιφα, **ἔρρ**ιμμαι

3) On most verbs that begin with a **vowel**, reduplication involves **lengthening the vowel**, very similarly to a temporal augment on an indicative past tense verb. However, keep in mind that this lengthening ***must*** remain and not be undone when forming perfect infinitive, participle, subjunctive, optative, and imperative forms.

* ἀδικέω -> **ἠ**δίκηκα, **ἠ**δίκημαι
* αἱρέω -> **ᾕ**ρηκα, **ᾕ**ρημαι

4) Some verbs exhibit both a reduplication of an initial vowel + consonant *and* a lengthening of the vowel following the reduplicated syllable. These perfect forms may look completely irregular, but they often occur on commonly-seen verbs and must be memorized.

* ἀκούω -> ἀκήκοα
* ἔρχομαι -> ἐλήλυθα
* φέρω -> ἐνήνοχα, ἐνηνέγμαι

5) Some 4th and 5th principal parts are formed from stems that are difficult to intuit from the first principal part and don't necessarily fall into the rules listed above. Again, these forms may look completely irregular, but they often occur on commonly-seen verbs and must be memorized.

* ὁράω -> ἑώρακα / ἑόρακα, ἑώραμαι / ὦμμαι
* λαμβάνω -> εἴληφα, εἴλημμαι

In addition to reduplication, fourth principal parts often (thougn not always) exhibit a verb stem that ends in the letter kappa (κ) or an aspirated consonant (like θ, χ, or φ) as a perfect tense marker. Note the examples of κελεύω (κεκέλευ**κ**α), δείκνυμι (δέδει**χ**α), and ἀδικέω (ἠδίκη**κ**α), among many others.

## Perfect Active

As mentioned above, the **perfect active** is built on the **4th principal part**. You get the stem to which you need to add the personal endings by removing the **-α**.

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | -α | -αμεν |
| 2nd | -ας | -ατε |
| 3rd | -ε(ν) | -ασι(ν) |

Note that these endings look very similar to the first aorist active endings except for the third plural (1st aor.: -αν; perfect: -ασι(ν)).

Let's use the fourth principal part of φέρω, ἐνήνοχα, to demonstrate the conjugation of the perfect active:

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | ἐνήνοχα | ἐνηνόχαμεν |
| 2nd | ἐνήνοχας | ἐνηνόχατε |
| 3rd | ἐνήνοχε(ν) | ἐνηνόχασι(ν) |

Person, number, and voice work exactly the same as they do in other tenses; the only change in translation here is the tense of the verb:

* ἐνήνοχα -> "I have carried"
* ἐνηνόχασι -> "They have carried"

### Perfect Active Infinitive and Participle

The formation of the perfect active infinitive and participle is a simple matter of adding endings to the fourth principal part stem. Recall that no matter what kind of reduplication the fourth principal part exhibits, you do ***not*** need to change anything about the stem (unlike when you needed to un-augment aorist principal parts to form aorist infinitives and participles).

The perfect active infinitive ending is **-έναι**, with a persistent accent on the -ε-.

The perfect active participle endings are **-ώς, -υῖα, -ός (m./n. stem -ότ-)**. Note the persistent accent on the vowel of the ending.

Let's stick with φέρω -> ἐνήνοχα as our paradigm here.

* perfect active infinitive: ἐνηνοχέναι

* perfect active participle: ἐνηνοχώς, ἐνηνοχυῖα, ἐνηνοχός (m./n. stem ἐνηνοχότ-)

| | Masc. | Fem. | Neut. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Nom. Sg. | ἐνηνοχ**ώς** | ἐνηνοχ**υῖα** | ἐνηνοχ**ός** |
| Gen. Sg. | ἐνηνοχ**ότος** | ἐνηνοχ**υίας** | ἐνηνοχ**ότος** |
| Dat. Sg. | ἐνηνοχ**ότι** | ἐνηνοχ**υίᾳ** | ἐνηνοχ**ότι** |

| Nom. Pl. | ἐνηνοχ**ότες** | ἐνηνοχ**υῖαι** | ἐνηνοχ**ότα** |
| Gen. Pl. | ἐνηνοχ**ότων** | ἐνηνοχ**υιῶν** | ἐνηνοχ**ότων** |
| Dat. Pl. | ἐνηνοχ**όσι(ν)** | ἐνηνοχ**υίαις** | ἐνηνοχ**όσι(ν)** |

## Perfect Middle/Passive

The **perfect middle/passive** is built on the **5th principal part**, the stem of which you can determine by removing the ending **-μαι**, and like other tenses, the conjugation of the perfect middle/passive is a matter of combining personal endings with that stem. The endings in question are as follows:

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | -μαι | -μεθα |
| 2nd | -σαι | -σθε |
| 3rd | -ται | -νται |

Note that these endings are exactly the same as **athematic middle/passive endings of present tense -μι verbs**. That's because the perfect tense counts as a *primary* tense (i.e., not a past tense) and thus it uses primary tense endings.

However, the endings of the perfect middle/passive (and in particular the consonants that begin them) can affect the end of the 5th principal part stem in various ways, based on the letter that ends the stem. There are a few possible patterns, the full scope of which need not be memorized; it is enough to be able to identify a perfect middle/passive form based on clues like reduplication and its ending based on the chart above to identify person and number.

The most basic form of the perfect/middle passive involves a fifth principal part that ends in a **vowel**; for example, ἀδικέω has a fifth principal part **ἠδίκημαι**, the stem of which is **ἠδικη-**.

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | ἠδίκημαι | ἠδικήμεθα |
| 2nd | ἠδίκησαι | ἠδίκησθε |
| 3rd | ἠδίκηται | ἠδίκηνται |

If a fifth principal part ends in a consonant, however, the consonant can change from form to form based on its interaction with the consonant that begins the personal ending; sometimes, it works in the other direction, wherein the stem consonant affects the consonant of the personal ending. The chart below exhibits some of the possible patterns, and I've bolded the personal endings in each form with the warning that some letters get absorbed into the stem of some forms, while in other forms, the stem's final consonant melds with or gets affected by the consonant of the personal ending.

One other feature is worth pointing out: the **3rd plural** is what is termed a *periphrastic* form, a conjugated verb made up of two separate parts rather than one form. In this case, it is a combination of the **perfect middle/passive participle** in the appropriate **gender, case, and number** to match the subject along with **εἰσί(ν)** (the 3rd person plural form of the verb εἰμί).

| | κελεύω | γράφω | ἄγω | ἀγγέλλω |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | κεκέλευσ**μαι** | γέγραμ**μαι** | ἦγ**μαι** | ἤγγελ**μαι** |
| 2nd sg. | κεκέλευ**σαι** | γέγρα**ψαι** | ἦ**ξαι** | ἤγγελ**σαι** |
| 3rd sg. | κεκέλευσ**ται** | γέγραπ**ται** | ἦκ**ται** | ἤγγελ**ται** |
| 1st pl. | κεκελεύσ**μεθα** | γεγράμ**μεθα** | ἤγ**μεθα** | ἠγγέλ**μεθα** |
| 2nd pl. | κεκελεύ**σθε** | γέγραφ**θε** | ἦχ**θε** | ἤγγελ**θε** |
| 3rd pl. | κεκελευσμένοι εἰσί(ν) | γεγραμμένοι εἰσί(ν) | ἠγμένοι εἰσί(ν) | ἠγγελμένοι εἰσί(ν) |

### Perf. Mid./Pass. Infinitive and Participle

The perfect middle/passive infinitive and participle are also formed from the 5th principal part stem, again using analogous endings from present tense middle/passive -μι verbs:

* infinitive: -σθαι
* participle: -μένος, -μένη, -μένον

One difference here is that the perfect middle/passive infinitive will be accented persistently on the last vowel of the stem, and perfect middle/passive participle endings exhibit a persistent accent over the first syllable (-μεν-).

As above with the perfect active infinitive and participles, no matter what kind of reduplication the fifth principal part exhibits, you do ***not*** need to change anything about the stem, even if it looks like the lengthened vowel (as in an augment). Reduplication is an essential part of the perfect verb stem and cannot be undone.

So, note the following perfect middle/passive infinitive and participle from ἀδικέω (5th pp. ἠδίκημαι):

* future passive infinitive: ἠδικῆσθαι
* future passive participle: ἠδικημένος, ἠδικημένη, ἠδικημένον

### Practice Opportunity 2

All the given forms are perfect middle/passive. For all exercises, identify the **first principal part** of the verb. Then, if the given verb form is *finite*, identify its **person and number**. If the given form is a *participle*, identify its **gender, case, and number**. If the given form is the *infinitive*, you don't need to do anything.

Make sure to use clues like reduplication and the form's ending in conjunction with resources like the [verb principal parts list](../../reference/verb-principal-parts). Remember that you can use control + F (on Windows) or command + F (on Mac) within the list to search the page, and you can copy and paste the first few letters of these forms to look for fifth principal parts that match.

## Pluperfect and Future Perfect

There are two remaining tenses out of the seven in ancient Greek which are exceedingly rare and which we'll treat only in passing here. Both tenses, the **pluperfect** and the **future perfect**, are related to the perfect in that both indicate a verbal action that has lasting effects into a later period of time.

The **pluperfect** indicates an action that **had occurred** *before* an event of the past, and the effects of the pluperfect action last into that past event. For example:

* The soldiers **had seen** the enemy before they attacked.

The action of seeing is a distant event of the past, as evidenced by the use of the verb form **"had [verb]ed"**, but the effects of the soldiers seeing the enemy persists into the time when they attacked.

The **future perfect** indicates an action that **will have occurred** *before* an event of the future, and the effects of the future perfect action last into that future event. For example:

* The soldiers **will have seen** the enemy before they (will) attack.

The relationship of the action of seeing and the action of attacking is similar here; the effects of the future perfect action of seeing will last into the future action of attacking.

The formation of the pluperfect and future perfect are complicated and worth putting off until a later stage of study. The short version is that the pluperfect is formed using augmented 4th and 5th principal parts and special secondary tense endings; the future perfect is formed using 4th and 5th principal parts with a sigma (the future tense marker) at the end of the stem before primary tense endings.
