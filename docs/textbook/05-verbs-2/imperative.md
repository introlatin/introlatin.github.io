## Imperative Mood

The **imperative mood** is the fourth out of the four moods of the finite Greek verb (the others being the indicative, subjunctive, and optative). Unlike the subjunctive and the optative, the **imperative** has one use: to show that the speaker views a verb's action as a **command**, either in the **second person** or **third person**. For example:

* Look at the ship!
* Listen to me!
* Let them eat cake.

In each of these sentences, the main verb conveys a command that somebody do something. In the first two examples, the verb is directed in the **second person** at an addressee who's listening to the command: "[You], look at the ship!" "[You], listen to me!" In the third example, the verb is directed in the **third person** to someone outside of the speaker-addressee relationship: "Let **them** [as opposed to me or you] eat cake."

Like other finite verbs, imperative mood verbs have a person, number, tense, and voice, and the identification of a finite verb as being in the imperative mood depends on the combination of which stem is combined with which ending. The imperative most often occurs in the **present** and **aorist** tenses, with the **perfect** appearing rarely enough in Greek literature that we will not discuss it in this unit.

As with the subjunctive and the optative, however, the **tense** of an **imperative** verb indicates **aspect**, not absolute time. This is a necessity, as commands by their nature imply that the action being commanded hasn't happened yet.

## Present Imperative

When forming the **present imperative** in either the active or the middle/passive, we must take into consideration, as usual, the type of first principal part of the verb: is it -ω or -μι? Is it an ε, α, or ο contract?

### -ω Verbs
{: .no_toc }

The endings of the **present imperative** for **thematic (-ω) verbs** are as follows:

| | Active | Middle/Passive |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2nd sg. | -ε | -ου |
| 3rd sg. | -έτω | -έσθω |
| 2nd pl. | -ετε | -εσθε |
| 3rd pl. | -όντων | -έσθων |

Note that the 2nd person plural and the 2nd person singular mid./pass. imperative endings match their indicative counterparts, so context will often have to help you determine which mood of the verb you're looking at. Here are some examples of the imperative in action:

* μανθάνετε τούσδε τοὺς λόγους.
    * [if imperative] Learn these words!
    * [if indicative] You all are learning these words.
* ὁ ἵππος εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν ἀγέσθω. Let the horse be led into the road.
* τοῦ διδασκάλου ἄκουε. Listen to the teacher!

The 3rd person plural present active imperative looks just like the present active masculine/neuter genitive plural participle. The key difference will be the use of the verb form as a main verb versus a verbal adjective, as in, for example, the genitive absolute. Note the differences in the following:

* βαλλόντων τὰ ὅπλα. Let them throw the weapons. (βαλλόντων as 3rd pl. pres. act. imp., the main verb)
* τῶν πολιτῶν τὰ ὅπλα βαλλόντων, ὁ στρατὸς εἰς τὴν πόλιν εἰσῆλθεν. While the citizens were throwing the weapons, the army entered into the city. (βαλλόντων as present active participle, masc. gen. pl., in a genitive absolute with τῶν πολιτῶν)

### Contract Verbs
{: .no_toc }

Contract verbs will use the same endings, but combine the theme vowel of the ending with the stem vowel (ε, α, or ο) according to the [regular rules](../../reference/contractions).

* ποιείτω ἀγαθὰ ὁ παῖς. Let the child do good things! (ποιε- + -ετω)
* τὴν θάλατταν ὅρα. Look at the sea! (ὁρα- + -ε)
* τοὺς λόγους δηλοῦτε. Make your words clear. (δηλο- + -ετε)

### -μι Verbs
{: .no_toc }

The endings of the **present imperative** for **athematic (-μι) verbs** are largely the same as those for thematic verbs, but without the thematic vowels of -ε- or -ο- (with a seeming exception in the 2nd sg. mid./pass. to be discussed after the chart):

| | Active | Middle/Passive |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2nd sg. | -- or -ε | -σο |
| 3rd sg. | -τω | -σθω |
| 2nd pl. | -τε | -σθε |
| 3rd pl. | -ντων | -σθων |

The 2nd sg. mid./pass. ending -σο is actually in line with the 2nd sg. act. ending -ου, which derives from the thematic vowel -ε- + the personal ending -σο. The intervocalic sigma between the epsilon and omicron drops out, and the -εο contracts into -ου.

When conjugating the imperatives of the core four -μι verbs, each will use its short vowel stem (δίδωμι > διδο-, τίθημι > τιθε-, ἵστημι > ἱστα-, ἵημι > ἱε-) with the 2nd sg. act. ending -ε, but that ending will contract with the short vowel according to the [regular rules](../../reference/contractions), with the exception of ἵστημι which combines -α- and -ε into -η:

* δείκνυ τῷ πατρὶ τὸν ποταμὸν. Show the river to your father.
* τὸν οἶνον μείγνυτε. Mix the wine!
* δίδου ἐμοὶ τὸ βιβλίον. Give the book to me!
* τοὺς παῖδας παρ' ἐμὲ ἵστη. Make the children stand near me!
* παρ' ἐμὲ ἵστασο. Stand near me!
* τὰ γέρα ἐν τῇ οἰκίᾳ τιθέσθω. Let the gifts be placed in the house.

## Aorist Imperative

In all of the prior examples, the **present tense** of the **imperative** indicates that the action in the command is continuous or ongoing, since the present imperative expresses **aspect**, as opposed to absolute time. Compare this against the **aorist imperative**, which will indicate that the action in the command is instantaneous or completed.

As in the other moods, the aorist imperative is built on the **third** or **sixth principal part**, depending on the voice of the verb: third for active or middle, sixth for passive.

Like the subjunctive, optative, infinitive, and participle, the **aorist imperative** is built on an **unaugmented stem**, so you need to make sure to downgrade the initial vowel if a temporal augment or remove the ἐ- if a syllabic augment.

### Aorist Active and Middle

As with the present imperative, aorist active or middle imperatives must take into consideration the type of third principal part under consideration: is it a 2nd (-ον) or 1st (-α) aorist? Is it a regular aorist or an athematic aorist (e.g., δίδωμι or γιγνώσκω)?

#### Strong/2nd Aorist
{: .no_toc }

The endings of the **aorist imperative** for **second aorist verbs** match those of present -ω verbs (with some accentuation differences); they are as follows:

| | Active | Middle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2nd sg. | -ε | -οῦ |
| 3rd sg. | -έτω | -έσθω |
| 2nd pl. | -ετε | -εσθε |
| 3rd pl. | -όντων | -έσθων |

* μάθετε τούσδε τοὺς λόγους. Learn these words!
* ὁ ἵππος εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν ἀγαγέσθω. Let the horse be led into the road.

These examples are the same as those used above but with the imperative verb changed into the aorist tense. The difference between μανθάνετε and μάθετε and ἀγέσθω and ἀγαγέσθω is **aspect**. The latter, for example, determines whether the act of the horse being led into the road happens over a period of time (ἀγέσθω, present tense) or instantaneously (ἀγαγέσθω, aorist tense).

#### Weak/1st Aorist
{: .no_toc }

The endings of the **aorist imperative** for **first aorist verbs** use similar personal endings but with the characteristic -α- tense vowel rather than the ε or ο theme vowel. In addition, the 2nd singular exhibits new endings entirely. They are as follows:

| | Active | Middle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2nd sg. | -ον | -αι |
| 3rd sg. | -άτω | -άσθω |
| 2nd pl. | -ατε | -ασθε |
| 3rd pl. | -άντων | -άσθων |

Note that the 2nd person sg. aor. mid. ending -αι looks exactly like the weak aorist active infinitive ending -αι. The difference lies in accentuation: the 2nd person aor. act. mid. imperative has a *recessive* accent (with the -αι considered short), while the weak aorist active infinitive is accented *persistently* on the syllable before the -αι (with the -αι considered short). Another way to tell the difference is that infinitives cannot serve as the sole verb forms in their sentence; they usually depend on a main verb of some sort. So, for example:

* τοῦ διδασκάλου ἄκουσαι. Listen to the teacher! (2nd person sg. aorist middle imperative)
* κελεύω ὑμᾶς τοῦ διδασκάλου ἀκοῦσαι. I am ordering you all to listen to the teacher. ([weak] aorist active infinitive, complementary infinitive after the main verb κελεύω)

Here are some other examples of the first aorist imperative:

* τὸν οἶνον μεῖξον. Mix the wine!
* νικησάντων τὸν ἀγῶνα. Let them win the contest.

#### Athematic Aorist
{: .no_toc }

Athematic aorists use their short vowel stems and largely the same endings as [athematic present imperatives](#-μι-verbs) with the exception of the 2nd sg. active, which uses the ending -ς, and the 2nd sg. middle, which uses the ending -ου (which will contract with the stem vowel).

| | Active | Middle/Passive |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2nd sg. | -ς | -ου |
| 3rd sg. | -τω | -σθω |
| 2nd pl. | -τε | -σθε |
| 3rd pl. | -ντων | -σθων |

* δὸς ἐμοὶ τὸ βιβλίον. Give the book to me!
* ἄφετε (ἀπό + -ἑ- + -τε) τοὺς ἱππέας. Send the cavalrymen away!
* οἱ μαθηταὶ παρὰ τὴν ὁδὸν τὰ βιβλία θέσθων. Let the students place the books next to the road.

The intransitive aorist of ἵστημι (ἔστην), γιγνώσκω, βαίνω, and δύω have only aorist active imperatives, and they will mostly use their long vowel stems (στη-, γνω-, βη-, and δῡ- respectively) with some unique endings possible (e.g., -θι for 2nd sg.). In addition, the 3rd pl. alone will use the short vowel stem (στα-, γνο-, βα-, and δῠ- respectively).

| | ἵστημι (intr.) | γιγνώσκω | βαίνω | δύω |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2nd sg. | στῆθι or -στα | γνῶθι | βῆθι or -βα | δῦθι |
| 3rd sg. | στήτω | γνώτω | βήτω | δύτω |
| 2nd pl. | στῆτε | γνῶτε | βῆτε | δῦτε |
| 3rd pl. | στάντων | γνόντων | βάντων | δύντων |

### Aorist Passive

The aorist passive uses the unaugmented long vowel stem of the 6th principal part (essentially the 6th principal part without an augment and minus its -ν) for 2nd sg., 3rd sg., and 2nd pl., and the unaugmented short vowel stem of the 6th principal part (essentially the 6th principal part without an augment and minus its -ην but plus -ε) for 3rd pl. To either stem, you then add the appropriate ending for person and number.

| | Passive |
| ----- | ----- |
| 2nd sg. | -θι (if 6th pp. doesn't end in -θη-)<br>-τι (otherwise) |
| 3rd sg. | -τω |
| 2nd pl. | -τε |
| 3rd pl. | -ντων |

* τὸ βιβλίο γραφήτω. Let the book be written.
* ὀφθῆτι ἐπὶ τῇ ὁδῷ. Be seen on the road.
* οἱ ἵπποι εἰς τὴν ὁδὸν ἀχθέντων. Let the horses be led into the road.
