## Contract Verbs Refresher

As we learned from the [epsilon-contract verbs unit](../verbs/epsilon-contracts) from last semester, verb forms created from the **first principal part** (i.e., present tense and imperfect tense forms) will have an extra step in the conjugation or declension process **if the 1st pp stem ends in an epsilon**. That stem's epsilon must **contract** with the initial vowel of the ending that follows it to create a new vowel sound. For example:

* ποιέω > stem ποιε-

If we wanted to create the masculine genitive singular present active participle of this verb (with the ending -οντος):

* ποι**ε**- + -**ο**ντος = ποι**οῦ**ντος

The -ε- of the stem and the -ο- of the ending combine into the diphthong -ου- in the participle's final form.

Here is the full list of epsilon contractions. We used the first four last semester, and the remaining ones are new ones that we are going to need for new verb forms this semester:

Semester 1:
* ε + ει = ει
* ε + ου = ου
* ε + ε = ει
* ε + ο = ου
* ε + ω = ω

Semester 2:
* ε + ᾱ = η
* ε + α = η
* ε + η = η
* ε + αι = ῃ
* ε + ῃ = ῃ
* ε + οι = οι
* ε + ῳ = ῳ

## Alpha- and Omicron-Contracts

As indicated last semester, epsilon is not the only letter at the end of a first principal part stem that triggers a contraction; the same process needs to occur if the stem ends in an **alpha** or an **omicron** as well. However, due to the different phonological qualities of an alpha or an omicron compared to an epsilon, the combinations that result will necessarily be different than those that epsilon creates.

A full list of contractions for epsilons, alphas, and omicrons can be found [in the reference section](../../reference/contractions) of our site. Here is a list of both alpha and omicron contractions, beginning with those that apply directly to ending vowels that we learned about in the first semester and continuing with those that we will make use of later in this current semester.

Combinations for Semester 1 endings:
* α + ει = ᾳ (note the iota subscript)\*
* α + ε = α (long alpha)
* α + ου = ω
* α + ο = ω
* α + ω = ω
* ο + ει = οι\*\*
* ο + ε = ου
* ο + ου = ου
* ο + ο = ου
* ο + ω = ω

\* There is a specific exception for this: the -ει- of the **present active infinitive ending -ειν** is linguistically dissimilar to the -ει of the 3rd person singular present active ending, so it results in a different contraction: **-α-**. Thus, the present active infinitive of the verb ὁράω is **ὁρᾶν** (no iota subscript).

\*\* A similar exception applies with omicron-contracts and the **present active infinitive ending -ειν**; this specific form results in the contraction **-ου-**. So, for example, the present active infinitive of the verb δηλόω is **δηλοῦν**, rather than δηλοῖν.

Combinations for later this semester:
* α + ᾱ = ᾱ
* α + α = ᾱ
* α + η = ᾱ
* α + αι = αι
* α + ῃ = ᾳ
* α + οι = ῳ
* ο + οι = οι
* ο + ῃ = οι
* ο + η = ω
* ο + ῳ = ῳ

## ὁράω

One of the most common alpha-contract verbs is ὁράω, "to see." Its present tense forms (finite, infinitive, and participle) are all formed regularly according to the contraction rules above, so, for example:

* ὁ παῖς τὴν οἰκίαν ὁρᾷ. The child sees the house.
* οἱ σώφρονες ἠθέλησαν τὴν θάλατταν ὁρᾶν. The wise people wanted to see the sea.
* τὰ ὅπλα ὑπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ὁρώμενα ᾑρέθη. The weapons were seized after they were seen by the people.

However, when conjugating ὁράω in the imperfect, something unusual happens with its augment. Under normal circumstances, a verb that begins with a vowel like ο would add an augment (which, [as review](../verbs/imperfect#augment), indicates that the verb form in question is a finite verb in a past tense) by **lengthening** the initial vowel (temporal augment). ὁράω, however, in its earliest forms actually began with a consonant that dropped out of use in the Greek alphabet by the Classical era (the digamma, ϝ, which had a "w" sound). As a result, **the imperfect forms of ὁράω undergo a unique** ***double*** **augmentation**: it both lengthens the ο into an ω *and* it adds a roughened *syllabic* augment of ἑ- to the beginning.

Thus, the imperfect forms of ὁράω look like the following. Keep in mind that each form exhibits the double augment at the beginning and the alpha contraction at the end.

| | Active | Middle/Passive |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ἑώρων | ἑωρώμην |
| 2nd sg. | ἑώρας | ἑωρῶ |
| 3rd sg. | ἑώρα | ἑωρᾶτο |
| 1st pl. | ἑωρῶμεν | ἑωρώμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | ἑωρᾶτε | ἑωρᾶσθε |
| 3rd pl. | ἑώρων | ἑωρῶντο |
