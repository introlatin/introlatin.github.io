## Athematic Aorists

The core four -μι verbs that we learned about [in the previous unit](athematic) along with four -ω verbs exhibit a third principal part that conjugates in the aorist active and middle with **athematic conjugation patterns**. This means that for these verbs, we cannot simply classify its third principal part as [first aorist](../verbs/first-aorist) or [second aorist](../verbs/second-aorist) and apply the appropriate endings; we have to take special stem changes and athematic endings into account.

A quick reminder of the **secondary tense endings for athematic verbs**:

| | Secondary Tense Act. | Secondary Tense Middle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | -ν | -μην |
| 2nd sg. | -ς | -σο |
| 3rd sg. | -- | -το |
| 1st pl. | -μεν | -μεθα |
| 2nd pl. | -τε | -σθε |
| 3rd pl. | -σαν | -ντο |

* secondary active infinitive: -ναι
* secondary active participle: -ς, -σα, -ν (m./n. stem -ντ-)
* secondary middle infinitive: -σθαι
* secondary middle participle: -μενος, -μένη, -μενον

## -ω Verbs with Athematic Aorists

Four -ω verbs have **athematic aorists** are βαίνω, γιγνώσκω, δύω, and ἁλίσκομαι, along with any compounds formed from those verbs (like διαβαίνω from the [Result Clauses unit](../syntax-2/result-clauses)). Note that this affects only the forms of these verbs built on the third principal part; the present tense of these verbs, for example, is conjugated according to thematic patterns.

Note that the third principal part of each of these verbs does not end in the characteristic -(σ)α of first aorists or -ον of second aorists; rather, each ends with the athematic 1st sg. ending of -ν, which is attached to a stem that exhibits a long vowel.

* βαίνω > **ἔβην**, stem βη-
* γιγνώσκω > **ἔγνων**, stem γνω-
* δύω > **ἔδυν**, stem δυ-
* ἁλίσκομαι > **ἑάλων**, stem ἑάλω- or ἁλω-

Unlike the core four -μι verbs, this long vowel stem persists throughout all aorist forms of these verbs. Note also that these forms have only an active voice; they do not have a middle voice.

The aorist active stem of each of these verbs can be found by removing **-ν** from the third principal part. To that stem we add the secondary tense athematic endings.

### Aorist Active

| | βαίνω | γιγνώσκω | δύω | ἁλίσκομαι |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | -ἔβην | ἔγνων | ἔδυν | ἑάλων |
| 2nd sg. | -ἔβης | ἔγνως | ἔδυς | ἑάλως |
| 3rd sg. | -ἔβη | ἔγνω | ἔδυ | ἑάλω |
| 1st pl. | -ἔβημεν | ἔγνωμεν | ἔδυμεν | ἑάλωμεν |
| 2nd pl. | -ἔβητε | ἔγνωτε | ἔδυτε | ἑάλωτε |
| 3rd pl. | -ἔβησαν | ἔγνωσαν | ἔδυσαν | ἑάλωσαν |
| aor. act. inf. | βῆναι | γνῶναι | δῦναι | ἁλῶναι |
| aor. act. part. | βάς, βᾶσα, βάν (βαντ-) | γνούς, γνοῦσα, γνόν (γνοντ-) | δύς, δῦσα, δύν (δυντ-) | ἁλούς, ἁλοῦσα, ἁλόν (ἁλοντ-) |

Some vocabulary notes:
* Note that the aorist of βαίνω usually occurs only in complex forms in Greek prose. Hence, you may see forms like διαβαίνω, "to step through" or "to cross" > διέβη, "he crossed", but a simplex form like ἔβη will usually only appear in Greek poetry.
* ἁλίσκομαι, "to be caught, seized", exhibits **aorist active** conjugation, as evidenced by the endings being used, but strangely, these forms are translated in the **passive voice**. Thus, for example, ἑάλωμεν means "we **were seized**."

## Athematic Aorists of the Cour Four -μι Verbs

The core four -μι verbs that we learned about [in the last unit](athematic) will exhibit athematic conjugation in their aorist tense as well. However, as opposed to the previous athematic aorists, the aorists of δίδωμι, τίθημι, ἵημι, and ἵστημι will have special considerations, including alternating stems.

### δίδωμι, τίθημι, ἵημι

The third principal parts of δίδωμι, τίθημι, and ἵημι look deceptively like first aorists due to their ending in -α:

* δίδωμι > **ἔδωκα**
* τίθημι > **ἔθηκα**
* ἵημι > **-ἧκα**

These three verbs will conjugate like a **first aorist** in the **aorist active singular**; this means that it will use the first aorist endings in those persons and numbers. However, for **all other aorist active and middle forms**, each verb will use a **short vowel stem** and **athematic endings**.

* **ἔδωκα**: aor. act. sg. stem (ἐ)δωκ-, short vowel stem (ἐ)δο-
* **ἔθηκα**: aor. act. sg. stem (ἐ)θηκ-, short vowel stem (ἐ)θε-
* **-ἧκα**: aor. act. sg. stem ἡκ-, short vowel stem ἑ- (augmented: εἱ-)

#### Aorist Active

| | δίδωμι | τίθημι | ἵημι |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ἔδωκα | ἔθηκα | -ἧκα |
| 2nd sg. | ἔδωκας | ἔθηκας | -ἧκας |
| 3rd sg. | ἔδωκε(ν) | ἔθηκε(ν) | -ἧκε(ν) |
| 1st pl. | ἔδομεν | ἔθεμεν | -εἷμεν |
| 2nd pl. | ἔδοτε | ἔθετε | -εἷτε |
| 3rd pl. | ἔδοσαν | ἔθεσαν | -εἷσαν |
| aor. act. inf. | δοῦναι | θεῖναι | -εἷναι |
| aor. act. part. | δούς, δοῦσα, δόν (δοντ-) | θείς, θεῖσα, θέν (θεντ-) | -εἷς, -εἷσα, -ἕν (-ἑντ-) |

* Note that the aorist active infinitives and the aorist active pariticples in the masculine nominative singular and feminine forms lengthen the short vowel stem in unexpected ways.

#### Aorist Middle

| | δίδωμι | τίθημι | ἵημι |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ἐδόμην | ἐθέμην | -εἵμην |
| 2nd sg. | ἔδου\* | ἔθου\* | -εἷσο |
| 3rd sg. | ἔδοτο | ἔθετο | -εἷτο |
| 1st pl. | ἐδόμεθα | ἐθέμεθα | -εἵμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | ἔδοσθε | ἔθεσθε | -εἷσθε |
| 3rd pl. | ἔδοντο | ἔθεντο | -εἷντο |
| aor. act. inf. | δόσθαι | θέσθαι | -ἕσθαι |
| aor. act. part. | δόμενος, -η, -ον | θέμενος, -η, -ον | -ἕμενος, -η, -ον |

\* The 2nd sg. aor. mid. of δίδωμι and τίθημι both drop their intervocalic sigmas and contract the remaining vowels to form the diphthong -ου: ἔδοσο > ἔδοο > ἔδου; ἔθεσο > ἔθεο > ἔθου.

### ἵστημι

ἵστημι has two different third principal parts: **ἔστησα** and **ἔστην**. The first is a completely regular first aorist, while the latter follows the athematic patterns of βαίνω (one consistent long vowel stem that uses athematic endings).

| | ἔστησα | ἔστην |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ἔστησα | ἔστην |
| 2nd sg. | ἔστησας | ἔστης |
| 3rd sg. | ἔστησε(ν) | ἔστη |
| 1st pl. | ἐστήσαμεν | ἔστημεν |
| 2nd pl. | ἐστήσατε | ἔστητε |
| 3rd pl. | ἔστησαν | ἔστησαν |

The major difference is in the **meaning** of each aorist. The forms of **ἔστησα** are **transitive**, like the active forms of ἵστημι that we learned about in the last unit, and as a result, they take direct objects. For example:

* τοὺς ἵππους παρὰ τὴν οἰκίαν **ἐστήσαμεν**. **We made** the horses **stand** near the house.

The forms of **ἔστην**, on the other hand, are **intransitive**, like the middle/passive forms of ἵστημι, and generally won't take direct objects. For example:

* παρὰ τὴν οἰκίαν **ἔστημεν**. **We stood** near the house.

Be aware, though, that the **3rd plural** of both forms looks exactly the same: **ἔστησαν**. Both, however, are formed from different components:

* ἔστησαν from ἔστησα = ἐ- (augment) + -στησ- (stem) + -αν (1st aorist ending)
* ἔστησαν from ἔστην = ἐ- (augment) + -στη- (stem) + -σαν (athematic ending)

You will often need context to tell which form of the aorist ἔστησαν derives from. For example, the presence of a direct object will indicate that you're dealing with the *transitive* form of the verb, rather than the intransitive form which doesn't take a direct object:

* τοὺς ἵππους παρὰ τὴν οἰκίαν **ἔστησαν**. **They made** the horses **stand** near the house.
* παρὰ τὴν οἰκίαν **ἔστησαν**. **They stood** near the house.
