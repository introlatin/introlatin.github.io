## Subjunctive Formation

The subjunctive occurs in three tenses that indicate aspect: **present**, **aorist**, and **perfect**. The formation of the subjunctive, then, like the indicative, is a matter of matching an appropriate verb stem with an appropriate personal ending to reflect person and number.

There are some concepts to keep in mind, though, that make the conjugation of the subjunctive distinct from the conjugation of the indicative, especially when comparing across the different tenses:

* The subjunctive endings in general are **the same** across **the present and aorist tenses**. (The endings can apply in certain circumstances for the **perfect** tense, on which see below.)
* The subjunctive endings are also **the same** across **both -ω and -μι conjugation verbs** and **both first and second aorists**.
* The subjunctive is formed on an **unaugmented stem** (since the subjunctive is not the indicative). This means that any forms built on the 3rd or 6th principal parts will need to be unaugmented in the same way that they are for infinitives and participles (refer back to [Aorist Infinitives](../infs-and-parts/infinitive-formation#aorist-infinitives) in the Infinitive Formation unit for rules).

## Subjunctive Endings

The endings of the subjunctive are as follows:

| Subjunctive | Active | Middle/Passive |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | -ω | -ωμαι |
| 2nd sg. | -ῃς | -ῃ |
| 3rd sg. | -ῃ | -ηται |
| 1st pl. | -ωμεν | -ώμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | -ητε | -ησθε |
| 3rd pl. | -ωσι(ν) | -ωνται |

The subjunctive endings are mostly the primary indicative endings with **lengthened thematic vowels**. Compare, for example, the middle/passive endings side-by-side, with the thematic vowels bolded for emphasis:

| | Indicative M./P. | Subjunctive M./P. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | -**ο**μαι | -**ω**μαι |
| 2nd sg. | -ῃ\* | -ῃ\* |
| 3rd sg. | -**ε**ται | -**η**ται |
| 1st pl. | -**ό**μεθα | -**ώ**μεθα |
| 2nd pl. | -**ε**σθε | -**η**σθε |
| 3rd pl. | -**ο**νται | -**ω**νται |

\* Both of these endings result from the dropping of an intervocalic sigma and a contraction of remaining vowels; the indicative comes from -εσαι while the subjunctive comes from -ησαι.

These endings apply to **all tenses of the subjunctive**. This means that while endings like -ηται or -ωνται seem applicable only to the present tense, they will apply for the aorist and perfect tenses as well.

***

## Subjunctive Conjugation

To form the subjunctive, in most cases, you can simply apply the endings above to the appropriate stem. One major exception will be the perfect tense, explained below.

### Present and Aorist Conjugation

The **present subjunctive** is formed from the stem of the **first principal part** for both the active and the middle/passive. The **aorist subjunctive** is formed from the **unaugmented** stem of the **third principal part for active and middle** and the **sixth principal part for passive**. The endings are the same for both first aorists and second aorists.

There are two complications with the **aorist passive subjunctive**.
* Anomalously, the aorist passive subjunctive will use the **active** endings: -ω, -ῃς, -ῃ, -ωμεν, -ητε, -ωσι(ν).
* The aorist passive stem must be unaugmented, and when removing the ending from the 6th principal part, it will retain an **-ε-** at the end of the stem. So, for example, λύω has a 6th principal part in ἐλύθην. The unaugmented form is λυθην; the removal of the ending -ην results in the stem λυθ-, but the stem will retain an -ε- as a holdover from the ending: **λυθε-**. This is important because this epsilon will **contract** with the endings that follow it.

Here is an example paradigm of κελεύω in the subjunctive across the present and aorist tenses.

| | Pres. Act. Subj. | Pres. M./P. Subj. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | κελεύω | κελεύωμαι |
| 2nd sg. | κελεύῃς | κελεύῃ |
| 3rd sg. | κελεύῃ | κελεύηται |
| 1st pl. | κελεύωμεν | κελευώμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | κελεύητε | κελεύησθε |
| 3rd pl. | κελεύωσι(ν) | κελεύωνται |

| | Aor. Act. Subj. | Aor. Mid. Subj. | Aor. Pass. Subj. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | κελεύσω | κελεύσωμαι | κελευσθῶ |
| 2nd sg. | κελεύσῃς | κελεύσῃ | κελευσθῇς |
| 3rd sg. | κελεύσῃ | κελεύσηται | κελευσθῇ |
| 1st pl. | κελεύσωμεν | κελευσώμεθα | κελευσθῶμεν |
| 2nd pl. | κελεύσητε | κελεύσησθε | κελευσθῆτε |
| 3rd pl. | κελεύσωσι(ν) | κελεύσωνται | κελευσθῶσι(ν) |

Note that these endings apply regardless of whether the verb in question is an -ω or -μι verb. So, the present subjunctive of δείκνυμι looks as follows:

| | Pres. Act. Subj. | Pres. M./P. Subj. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | δεικνύω | δεικνύωμαι |
| 2nd sg. | δεικνύῃς | δεικνύῃ |
| 3rd sg. | δεικνύῃ | δεικνύηται |
| 1st pl. | δεικνύωμεν | δεικνυώμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | δεικνύητε | δεικνύησθε |
| 3rd pl. | δεικνύωσι(ν) | δεικνύωνται |

We will discuss the contract verbs, the core four -μι verbs, and athematic aorists in the next major section below.

### Perfect Conjugation

The **perfect subjunctive** is quite rare compared to the present and the aorist subjunctive, but you should be aware of the rules of its composition in case it appears.

The **perfect active subjunctive** can be formed in two ways. The rarer method attaches the subjunctive endings directly to the stem of the 4th principal part. Thus:

| | Perf. Act. Subj. |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | κεκελεύκω |
| 2nd sg. | κεκελεύκῃς |
| 3rd sg. | κεκελεύκῃ |
| 1st pl. | κεκελεύκωμεν |
| 2nd pl. | κεκελεύκητε |
| 3rd pl. | κεκελεύκωσι(ν) |

The more common method is a **periphrastic formation**, combining the **perfect active participle** (which agrees with its subject in gender, case, and number) with the **present active subjunctive of εἰμί**. You can see the full paradigm below. (We'll discuss the subjunctive forms of εἰμί in the final section of this unit.)

| | Perf. Act. Subj. |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | κεκελευκώς, -υῖα, -ός ὦ |
| 2nd sg. | κεκελευκώς, -υῖα, -ός ᾖς |
| 3rd sg. | κεκελευκώς, -υῖα, -ός/-ότα ᾖ |
| 1st pl. | κεκελευκότες, -υῖαι ὦμεν |
| 2nd pl. | κεκελευκότες, -υῖαι ἦτε |
| 3rd pl. | κεκελευκότες, -υῖαι ὦσι(ν) |

The **perfect middle/passive subjunctive** is similarly formed periphrastically, using the **perfect middle/passive participle** rather than the active participle. While simple forms that attach the middle/passive endings to the fifth principal part exist in a very small number of verbs, they are exceedingly rare.

| | Perf. M./P. Subj. |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | κεκελευσμένος, -η, -ον ὦ |
| 2nd sg. | κεκελευσμένος, -η, -ον ᾖς |
| 3rd sg. | κεκελευσμένος, -η, -ον/-α ᾖ |
| 1st pl. | κεκελευσμένοι, -αι ὦμεν |
| 2nd pl. | κεκελευσμένοι, -αι ἦτε |
| 3rd pl. | κεκελευσμένοι, -αι ὦσι(ν) |

## Contracts, Athematics, and Irregulars

The **contract verbs** will act as expected in the **present subjunctive**: the -ε, -α, or -ο will **contract** with the initial vowel of the ending that attaches to the stem. A full listing of contractions, including those with vowels that we have not yet encountered, can be found [in the Reference section](../../reference/contractions).

Here are some paradigms for each of the contract types:

### Epsilon-Contracts, e.g. ποιέω

| | Pres. Act. Subj. | Pres. M./P. Subj. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ποιῶ | ποιῶμαι |
| 2nd sg. | ποιῇς | ποιῇ |
| 3rd sg. | ποιῇ | ποιῆται |
| 1st pl. | ποιῶμεν | ποιώμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | ποιῆτε | ποιῆσθε |
| 3rd pl. | ποιῶσι(ν) | ποιῶνται |

### Alpha-Contracts, e.g. ὁράω

| | Pres. Act. Subj. | Pres. M./P. Subj. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ὁρῶ | ὁρῶμαι |
| 2nd sg. | ὁρᾷς | ὁρᾷ |
| 3rd sg. | ὁρᾷ | ὁρᾶται |
| 1st pl. | ὁρῶμεν | ὁρώμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | ὁρᾶτε | ὁρᾶσθε |
| 3rd pl. | ὁρῶσι(ν) | ὁρῶνται |

Note that because of the way that alpha-contractions work, **the present indicative and present subjunctive of alpha-contract verbs look exactly the same** and you will need context to figure out which mood a verb is.

### Omicron-Contracts, e.g. δηλόω

| | Pres. Act. Subj. | Pres. M./P. Subj. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | δηλῶ\* | δηλῶμαι |
| 2nd sg. | δηλοῖς\* | δηλοῖ\* |
| 3rd sg. | δηλοῖ\* | δηλῶται |
| 1st pl. | δηλῶμεν | δηλώμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | δηλῶτε | δηλῶσθε |
| 3rd pl. | δηλῶσι(ν) | δηλῶνται |

\* Note that these forms look exactly like their indicative counterparts and you will again need context to figure out whether the form in question is indicative or subjunctive.

### Athematics and Irregulars

A new consideration is that the core four -μι verbs and the athematic aorists that we learned about a few units ago will *also* experience contraction in the present and the aorist subjunctive. The contraction schemes fit into the -ε and -ο patterns as follows, with the stem indicated after the appropriate tense. Do note that even if a stem ends in -α, it will still fall into an epsilon-contract pattern.

1. epsilon-contracts
  * τίθημι (present: τιθε-; aorist: θε-)
  * ἵστημι (present: ἱστα-; aorist: στα-)
  * ἵημι (present: ἱε-; aorist: -ἑ-)
  * φημί (present: φα-)
  * βαίνω (aorist: βα-)
2. omicron-contracts
  * δίδωμι (present: διδο-; aorist: δο-)
  * γιγνώσκω (aorist: γνο-)
  * ἁλίσκομαι (aorist: ἁλο-)

Here are the paradigms for the present and aorist subjunctive of these verbs, in addition to some irregular verbs (εἰμί, εἶμι, and φημί) that we've met so far.

#### Present Active Subjunctive
{: .no_toc }

| Pres. Act. Subj. | τίθημι | ἵστημι | ἵημι | δίδωμι |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| 1st sg. | τιθῶ | ἱστῶ | ἱῶ | διδῶ |
| 2nd sg. | τιθῇς | ἱστῇς | ἱῇς | διδῷς\* |
| 3rd sg. | τιθῇ | ἱστῇ | ἱῇ | διδῷ\* |
| 1st pl. | τιθῶμεν | ἱστῶμεν | ἱῶμεν | διδῶμεν |
| 2nd pl. | τιθῆτε | ἱστῆτε | ἱῆτε | διδῶτε |
| 3rd pl. | τιθῶσι(ν) | ἱστῶσι(ν) | ἱῶσι(ν) | διδῶσι(ν) |

\* These forms do not follow regular omicron-patterns and result in omega diphthongs (-ῳς and -ῳ), rather than the expected omicron diphthongs (-οις and -οι).

| Pres. Act. Subj. | εἰμί ("be")\* | εἶμι ("go")\*\* | φημί |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| 1st sg. | ὦ | ἴω | φῶ |
| 2nd sg. | ᾖς | ἴῃς | φῇς |
| 3rd sg. | ᾖ | ἴῃ | φῇ |
| 1st pl. | ὦμεν | ἴωμεν | φῶμεν |
| 2nd pl. | ἦτε | ἴητε | φῆτε |
| 3rd pl. | ὦσι(ν) | ἴωσι(ν) | φῶσι(ν) |

\* The present active subjunctive of εἶμι look basically like accented subjunctive endings.  
\*\* The present subjunctive forms of εἶμι differ from the present subjunctive forms of ἵημι only in breathing marks: the former have smooth breathings while the latter have rough breathings.

#### Present Middle/Passive Subjunctive
{: .no_toc }

| Pres. M./P. Subj. | τίθημι | ἵστημι | ἵημι | δίδωμι |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| 1st sg. | τιθῶμαι | ἱστῶμαι | ἱῶμαι | διδῶμαι |
| 2nd sg. | τιθῇ | ἱστῇ | ἱῇ | διδῷ\* |
| 3rd sg. | τιθῆται | ἱστῆται | ἱῆται | διδῶται |
| 1st pl. | τιθώμεθα | ἱστώμεθα | ἱώμεθα | διδώμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | τιθῆσθε | ἱστῆσθε | ἱῆσθε | διδῶσθε |
| 3rd pl. | τιθῶνται | ἱστῶνται | ἱῶνται | διδῶνται |

\* As in the active, this form uses an omega diphthong (-ῳ) rather than the expected omicron diphthong (-οι).

#### Aorist Active Subjunctive
{: .no_toc }

| Aor. Act. Subj. | τίθημι | ἵστημι (intrans.) | ἀφίημι\* | δίδωμι |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| 1st sg. | θῶ | στῶ | (ἀφ)ῶ | δῶ |
| 2nd sg. | θῇς | στῇς | (ἀφ)ῇς | δῷς\*\* |
| 3rd sg. | θῇ | στῇ | (ἀφ)ῇ | δῷ\*\* |
| 1st pl. | θῶμεν | στῶμεν | (ἀφ)ῶμεν | δῶμεν |
| 2nd pl. | θῆτε | στῆτε | (ἀφ)ῆτε | δῶτε |
| 3rd pl. | θῶσι(ν) | στῶσι(ν) | (ἀφ)ῶσι(ν) | δῶσι(ν) |

\* The aorist of ἵημι mainly occurs in complex forms, so the paradigm is presented here with the prefix ἀπό.  
\*\* As in the present active, these forms use omega diphthongs (-ῳς, -ῳ) rather than the expected omicron diphthongs (-οις, -οι).

| Aor. Act. Subj. | βαίνω | γιγνώσκω | ἁλίσκομαι |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | βῶ | γνῶ | ἁλῶ |
| 2nd sg. | βῇς | γνῷς\* | ἁλῷς\* |
| 3rd sg. | βῇ | γνῷ\* | ἁλῷ\* |
| 1st pl. | βῶμεν | γνῶμεν | ἁλῶμεν |
| 2nd pl. | βῆτε | γνῶτε | ἁλῶτε |
| 3rd pl. | βῶσι(ν) | γνῶσι(ν) | ἁλῶσι(ν) |

\* As with δίδωμι, these forms use omega diphthongs (-ῳς, -ῳ) rather than the expected omicron diphthongs (-οις, -οι).

#### Aorist Middle Subjunctive
{: .no_toc }

| Aor. Mid. Subj. | τίθημι | ἀφίημι | δίδωμι |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- |
| 1st sg. | θῶμαι | (ἀφ)ῶμαι | δῶμαι |
| 2nd sg. | θῇ | (ἀφ)ῇ | δῷ\* |
| 3rd sg. | θῆται | (ἀφ)ῆται | δῶται |
| 1st pl. | θώμεθα | (ἀφ)ώμεθα | δώμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | θῆσθε | (ἀφ)ῆσθε | δῶσθε |
| 3rd pl. | θῶνται | (ἀφ)ῶνται | δῶνται |

\* Again, this form uses an omega diphthong (-ῳ) rather than the expected omicron diphthong (-οι).
