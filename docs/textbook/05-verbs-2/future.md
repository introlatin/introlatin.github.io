## Future Tense Overview

The **future** tense, as discussed [in the verb overview](overview#verb-aspects), indicates an action that has yet to happen, i.e., it will happen *in the future*. The future tense can exhibit both aoristic and present aspects, meaning the future action can be a one-and-done or ongoing event. Here are a few examples:

* "They **will order**"
* "They **will be ordering**"
* "They **are going to order**"
* "They **shall order**"

These are all variations of the future tense of the verb "to order"; all of these actions *will* occur. Each is expressed slightly differently but equally as valid for indicating that core concept: that the verbal action in question has yet to happen and is not currently occurring.

Like the other tenses that you already know, the future tense can be expressed in any of the three voices. For example:

* active: "They will order"
* middle: "They will order (for themselves)"
* passive: "They will be ordered"

The future tense, however, is akin to the aorist tense, in that the **future active and middle voices** are built on *one* principal part, **the 2nd**, while the **future passive voice** is built on **the 6th**. This means that you need to return to the verbs that we learned about in the first semester and begin memorizing their **2nd principal parts** in order to put verbs into the future tense, at least in the active and middle voices.

### Second Principal Part and Future Tense Markers

The **second principal part** of any verb can end in either **-ω** or **-ομαι**, like present tense -ω verbs. To get the **future active or middle stem** in order to conjugate, you simply take the -ω or -ομαι off, and we'll discuss the endings that you attach to that stem below.

The other tenses and voices with which we've worked so far have exhibited certain linguistic markers that clue you into what tense or voice a verb is in. For example:

* The stem of **first aorists** often end in a **-σ-** or **sigma sound** (e.g., ψ 'ps' or ξ 'ks') before endings that usually exhibit the letter **α**.
* The stem of **aorist passives** often end in a **-θ-** with endings that usually exhibit the letter **η**.
* The stems of **past tense finite verbs** (i.e., imperfect or aorist tense) will begin with an **augment**, either the syllabic augment **ἐ-** or the long vowel/diphthong of a temporal augment.

The **future active and middle** (i.e., the forms built on the second principal part) will similarly usually have a tense marker: the letter **-σ-** at the end of the stem. This is the same tense marker that first aorists use, but there are two major differences: 1) aorists will begin with an **augment**, and the **endings** that aorists use will be different.

Nevertheless, the differences between a second principal part and a third principal part can be easy to miss or even non-existent in some circumstances. Look at the following examples:

* πέμπω > 2nd pp **πέμψω**, 3rd pp **ἔπεμψα**
* κελεύω > 2nd pp **κελεύσω**, 3rd pp **ἐκέλευσα**

In the first, the stem of the 2nd pp is **πεμψ-**, and similarly, the unaugmented stem of the 3rd pp is **πεμψ-**, which will be used for forms like infinitives and participles. In the second, the same similarity applies: both the 2nd pp stem and the unaugmented 3rd pp stem is **κελευσ-**.

So, you will have to make sure to use the **endings** of the form to determine what tense you are working with; as you will see, there is barely any, if any, overlap between future tense endings and first aorist tense endings.

The **future passive**, built on the 6th principal part, will exhibit the same -θ- of the stem that marks the aorist passive. The major difference will be that forms of the future passive will *un-augment* the stem. More on this below.

### Contract Futures

Some second principal parts will have an epsilon before the final -ω or -ομαι, much like an epsilon-contract in a first principal part. These verbs are called **contract futures**, because as with [present tense epsilon-contracts](../verbs/epsilon-contracts), you will need to contract the -ε- of the future active/middle stem with whatever vowel of the ending follows it. Note the following examples:

* ἀγγέλλω, **ἀγγελέω**, ἤγγειλα, ἤγγελκα, ἤγγελμαι, ἠγγέλθην - to announce
* ἀποκτείνω, **ἀποκτενέω**, ἀπέκτεινα, ἀπέκτονα, --, -- - to kill
* βάλλω, **βαλέω**, ἔβαλον, βέβληκα, βέβλημαι, ἐβλήθην - to throw, cast, hurl, hit
* νομίζω, **νομιέω**, ἐνόμισα, νενόμικα, νενόμισμαι, ἐνομίσθην - to think

In each of these verbs, the stem of the second principal part ends with -ε-, and we will need to follow the same rules as we do for present tense epsilon-contracts in combining the stem vowel with the ending vowel.

## Future Active and Middle

As mentioned above, the **future active and middle voices** are built on the **2nd principal part**, and you get the stem to which you need to add the personal endings by removing the **-ω** or **-ομαι**. The easy part about forming these voices is that you already know the personal endings to apply to the verb stem: they are exactly identical to the **present tense -ω** endings from last semester.

| | Active | Middle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | -ω | -ομαι |
| 2nd sg. | -εις | -ῃ |
| 3rd sg. | -ει | -εται |
| 1st pl. | -ομεν | -όμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | -ετε | -εσθε |
| 3rd pl. | -ουσι(ν) | -ονται |

You simply need to add these endings to the **future tense stem**, which is the **2nd principal part minus the ending -ω or -ομαι**. So, let's take the verb κελεύω, "to order", as our paradigm example.

| | Active | Middle |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | κελεύσω | κελεύσομαι |
| 2nd sg. | κελεύσεις | κελεύσῃ |
| 3rd sg. | κελεύσει | κελεύσεται |
| 1st pl. | κελεύσομεν | κελευσόμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | κελεύσετε | κελεύσεσθε |
| 3rd pl. | κελεύσουσι(ν) | κελεύσονται |

### Fut. Act. and Mid. Infinitives and Participles

Similary, the endings for the future active and middle infinitives and participles are exactly the same as those for **present tense -ω** verbs, but added to the **future stem** of the **2nd principal part**. So, if we keep using our paradigm verb κελεύω:

* future active infinitive: κελεύσειν
* future active participle: κελεύσων, κελεύσουσα, κελεῦσον (m./n. stem κελευσοντ-)
* future middle infinitive: κελεύσεσθαι
* future middle participle: κελευσόμενος, κελευσομένη, κελευσόμενον

## Future Passive

The **future passive** is built on the **6th principal part**, which you used last semester also to build the aorist passive. Because the future tense is a *primary* tense (i.e., not a past tense), we need to **un-augment** the stem of the 6th principal part in the same way that we would if we were forming an infinitive or participle from it. For a refresher on how to remove a syllabic or temporal augment from a verb, check out last semester's unit on [aorist infinitives](../infs-and-parts/infinitive-formation#aorist-infinitives).

So, our paradigm verb is κελεύω, which has a 6th principal part in ἐκελεύσθην. When we un-augment it, we are left with **κελευσθ-**. Then, to form the finite forms of the aorist passive, we can add the following endings (which all retain the -η- visible in the 6th principal part, add the characteristic -σ- future tense marker, and then use the future *middle* endings):

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | -ήσομαι | -ησόμεθα |
| 2nd | -ήσῃ | -ησέσθε |
| 3rd | -ήσεται | -ήσονται |

resulting in the following future passive forms for κελεύω:

| | Singular | Plural |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st | κελευσθήσομαι | κελευσθησόμεθα |
| 2nd | κελευσθήσῃ | κελευσθησέσθε |
| 3rd | κελευσθήσεται | κελευσθήσονται |

### Fut. Pass. Infinitive and Participle

The future passive infinitive and participle are similarly formed from the un-augmented 6th principal part stem. The endings are a similar combination of tense and voice markers: the -η- of the principal part, the tense marker -σ-, and the same endings that you used for the future middle (-εσθαι for the infinitive or -όμενος, -ομένη, -όμενον for the participle):

* future passive infinitive: κελευσθήσεσθαι
* future passive participle: κελευσθησόμενος, κελευσθησομένη, κελυσθησόμενον

### Practice Opportunity 2

All the given forms are aorist passive. For all exercises, identify the **first principal part** of teh verb. Then, if the given verb form is *finite*, identify its **person and number**. If the given form is a *participle*, identify its **gender, case, and number**. If the given form is the *infinitive*, you don't need to do anything.
