# Verbs 2

This module introduces new material relating to verbs in ancient Greek that builds upon the foundational knowledge that we began learning about in the first semester. Topics for this module include alpha- and omicron-contracts; the future and perfect tenses; "irregular" -μι verbs and athematic aorists; and the subjunctive, optative, and imperative moods.
