## Athematic Verb Review

Verbs belong to one of two major conjugations: **-ω** / **thematic** or **-μι** / **athematic**. The former exhibits a **thematic vowel, -ο- or -ε-**, as part of most of its personal endings, while the latter attaches the personal endings directly to the verb's stem without a thematic vowel. The endings for each conjugation will also sometimes look quite different, even if they indicate the same person, number, tense, and voice. Note the differences between the following:

Theme vowel:
* λύω > λύ**ο**μεν, 'we free' (1st plural present active, with the theme vowel -ο-)
* δείκνυμι > δείκνυμεν, 'we show' (1st plural present active, with no theme vowel before the -μεν ending)

Different endings:
* λύω > ἔλυον, 'they were freeing' (3rd plural imperfect active, with the ending -ον)
* δείκνυμι > ἐδείκνυσαν, 'they were showing' (3rd plural imperfect active, with the ending -σαν)

Thematic versus athematic is a concern for verb forms built from the **first principal part** (i.e., present and imperfect tense forms) and for some verbs built on the third principal part (about which we'll learn in the [Athematic Aorists unit](athematic-aorists)).

Until this point, we've dealt primarily with -μι verbs like δείκνυμι and μείγνυμι that exhibit seemingly regular conjugation patterns: chop off the -μι and add the appropriate ending that you need. I reproduce here the applicable -μι verb endings that we will use in conjugating the new -μι verbs introduced in this unit; however, as we'll see, these new verbs will have new considerations in their conjugations and formations.

Note that **primary tense** indicates non-past tenses of the verb, like the **present**. **Secondary tense** indicates past tenses of the verb, like the **imperfect** and the **aorist**.

| | Primary Tense Act. | Primary Tense Mid./Pass. | Secondary Tense Act. | Secondary Tense Mid./Pass. |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | -μι | -μαι | -ν | -μην |
| 2nd sg. | -ς | -σαι | -ς | -σο |
| 3rd sg. | -σι(ν) | -ται | -- | -το |

* present middle/passive infinitive: -σθαι
* present middle/passive participle: -μενος, -μένη, -μενον

## Core Four -μι Verbs

The most common -μι verbs are δίδωμι, τίθημι, ἵημι, and ἵστημι. Each of these verbs follows general athematic conjugation patterns, but the *stem* of the verb in the first principal part (and also in the third, as we'll learn later) ends in a vowel that will *change length* depending on the tense, voice, and number of the verb.

Some general patterns to note:
* These verbs will use a **long vowel stem** in the present and imperfect active singular forms; they will use a **short vowel stem** otherwise (including in infinitives and participles).
* The active infinitive is accented persistently on the syllable before -ναι; the middle/passive infinitive is accented recessively.
* The present active participles for each are listed below under the appropriate verb.

### ἵστημι

* Stem: ἱστη- / ἱστα-
* present active infinitive: ἱστάναι
* present active participle: ἱστάς, ἱστᾶσα, ἱστάν (m./n. stem ἱσταντ-)
* present middle/passive infinitive: ἵστασθαι
* present middle/passive participle: ἱστάμενος, -η, -ον

| | Present Active | Present Mid./Pass. | Imperfect Active | Imperfect Mid./Pass |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ἵστημι | ἵσταμαι | ἵστην | ἱστάμην |
| 2nd sg. | ἵστης | ἵστασαι | ἵστης | ἵστασο |
| 3rd sg. | ἵστησι(ν) | ἵσταται | ἵστη | ἵστατο |
| 1st pl. | ἵσταμεν | ἱστάμεθα | ἵσταμεν | ἱστάμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | ἵστατε | ἵστασθε | ἵστατε | ἵστασθε |
| 3rd pl. | ἱστᾶσι(ν)\* | ἵστανται | ἵστασαν | ἵσταντο |

\* In the 3rd pl. pres. act. of ἵστημι, note that the -ε- of the root and the -α- of the ending contract into -ᾱ-.  

* ὁ πατὴρ τοὺς παῖδας παρὰ τὴν οἰκίαν ἵστησιν. The father makes the children stand near the house.
* αἱ μητέρες τοὺς παῖδας παρὰ τὴν ναῦν ἱστᾶσιν. The mothers make the children stand near the ship.

### δίδωμι

* Stem: διδω- / διδο-
* present active infinitive: διδόναι
* present active participle: διδούς, διδοῦσα, διδόν (m./n. stem διδόντ-)
* present middle/passive infinitive: δίδοσθαι
* present middle/passive participle: διδόμενος, -η, -ον

| | Present Active | Present Mid./Pass. | Imperfect Active | Imperfect Mid./Pass |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | δίδωμι | δίδομαι | ἐδίδουν\* | ἐδιδόμην |
| 2nd sg. | δίδως | δίδοσαι | ἐδίδους\* | ἐδίδοσο |
| 3rd sg. | δίδωσι(ν) | δίδοται | ἐδίδου\* | ἐδίδοτο |
| 1st pl. | δίδομεν | διδόμεθα | ἐδίδομεν | ἐδιδόμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | δίδοτε | δίδοσθε | ἐδίδοτε | ἐδίδοσθε |
| 3rd pl. | διδόασι(ν) | δίδονται | ἐδίδοσαν | ἐδίδοντο |

\* Note that these forms are uncharacteristically built on the short vowel stem and borrow their endings from thematic verbs, including theme vowels that get contracted with the athematic verb stem (ἐδιδο- + -ον = ἐδίδουν; ἐδιδο- + -ες = ἐδίδους; ἐδιδο- + -ε = ἐδίδου).

* πρέπει τὸν μαθητὴν τὸ βιβλίον τῷ διδασκάλῳ δίδοναι. It is fitting for the student to give the book to the teacher.
* τὸ βιβλίον τὸ ὑπο τοῦ μαθητοῦ διδομένου μέγα ἐστίν. The book that is given by the student is large.

### τίθημι

* Stem: τιθη- / τιθε-
* present active infinitive: τιθέναι
* present active participle: τιθείς, τιθεῖσα, τιθέν (m./n. stem τιθέντ-)
* present middle/passive infinitive: τίθεσθαι
* present middle/passive participle: τιθέμενος, -η, -ον

| | Present Active | Present Mid./Pass. | Imperfect Active | Imperfect Mid./Pass |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | τίθημι | τίθεμαι | ἐτίθην | ἐτιθέμην |
| 2nd sg. | τίθης | τίθεσαι | ἐτίθεις\* | ἐτίθεσο |
| 3rd sg. | τίθησι(ν) | τίθεται | ἐτίθει\* | ἐτίθετο |
| 1st pl. | τίθεμεν | τιθέμεθα | ἐτίθεμεν | ἐτιθέμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | τίθετε | τίθεσθε | ἐτίθετε | ἐτίθεσθε |
| 3rd pl. | τιθέασι(ν) | τίθενται | ἐτίθεσαν | ἐτίθεντο |

\* As above with δίδωμι, note that these forms are uncharacteristically built on the short vowel stem and borrow their endings from thematic verbs, including theme vowels that get contracted with the athematic verb stem (ἐτιθε- + -ες = ἐτίθεις; ἐτιθε- + -ε = ἐτίθει).

* τὰ ὅπλα ἐπὶ τῇ τριήρει ἐτίθην. I was placing the weapons on the trireme.
* τὰ ὅπλα ἐπὶ τῇ τριήρει ὑπ' ἐμοῦ ἐτίθετο. The weapons were being placed on the trireme by me.

### ἵημι

* Stem: ἱη- / ἱε-
* present active infinitive: ἱέναι
* present active participle: ἱείς, ἱεῖσα, ἱέν (m./n. stem ἱέντ-)
* present middle/passive infinitive: ἵεσθαι
* present middle/passive participle: ἱέμενος, -η, -ον

| | Present Active | Present Mid./Pass. | Imperfect Active | Imperfect Mid./Pass |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ἵημι | ἵεμαι | ἵην | ἱέμην |
| 2nd sg. | ἵης | ἵεσαι | ἵεις\*\* | ἵεσο |
| 3rd sg. | ἵησι(ν) | ἵεται | ἵει\*\* | ἵετο |
| 1st pl. | ἵεμεν | ἱέμεθα | ἵεμεν | ἱέμεθα |
| 2nd pl. | ἵετε | ἵεσθε | ἵετε | ἵεσθε |
| 3rd pl. | ἱᾶσι(ν)\* | ἵενται | ἵεσαν | ἵεντο |

\* As in ἵστημι, in the 3rd pl. pres. act. of ἵημι, note that the -ε- of the root and the -α- of the ending contract into -ᾱ-.  
\*\* Note that as in δίδωμι and τίθημι, the 2nd and 3rd sg. imperfect active are built on the short vowel stem and borrow their endings from thematic verbs (ἱε- + -ες = ἵεις; ἱε- + -ε = ἵει).

* τὰ γέρα ἵεις, ὁ ἀνὴρ τὰ ὅπλα ἔλαβεν. While he was sending the gifts, the man took the weapons.
* κελεύει τοὺς ἱππέας τοὺς ἵππους ἱέναι. He orders the cavalrymen to send the horses.

## εἶμι

The verb **εἶμι**, "to go", is an irregular -μι verb that looks very similar to the linking verb that we know, εἰμί, "to be." The major difference between these two, besides some specific irregular forms, is their accentuation: the former verb is accented regularly across its forms and exhibits some different verb stems, while the forms of the latter are mostly enclitics. I list below the forms of both side-by-side:

| | εἶμι, "to go" - present tense | εἰμί, "to be" - present tense |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | εἶμι | εἰμί |
| 2nd sg. | εἶ | εἶ |
| 3rd sg. | εἶσι(ν) | ἐστί(ν) |
| 1st pl. | ἴμεν | ἐσμέν |
| 2nd pl. | ἴτε | ἐστέ |
| 3rd pl. | ἴασι(ν) | εἰσί(ν) |

| | εἶμι, "to go" - imperfect tense | εἰμί, "to be" - imperfect tense |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 1st sg. | ᾖα or ᾔειν | ἦν or ἦ |
| 2nd sg. | ᾔεισθα or ᾔεις | ἦσθα |
| 3rd sg. | ᾔειν or ᾔει | ἦν |
| 1st pl. | ᾖμεν  | ἦμεν |
| 2nd pl. | ᾖτε | ἦτε or ἦστε |
| 3rd pl. | ᾖσαν | ἦσαν |

| | εἶμι, "to go" | εἰμί, "to be" |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| pres. inf. | ἰέναι\* | εἶναι |
| pres. part. | ἰών, ἰοῦσα, ἰόν (m./n. stem ἰοντ-) | ὤν, οὖσα, ὄν (m./n. stem ὀντ-) |

\* Note that the only difference between this form and the present active infinitive of ἵημι (ἱέναι) is the breathing mark: ἰέναι > εἶμι has a smooth breathing, while ἱέναι > ἵημι has a rough breathing.

In translation, the present tense forms of εἶμι, "to go", have the force of the **future** tense. Thus:

* **εἶμι** εἰς τὴν ναῦν. **I will go** into the ship.
* οἱ πολῖται ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ **ἴασιν**. The citizens **will go** away from the road.

In this sense, εἶμι forms an alternative second principal part for the verb ἔρχομαι to create future tense forms of the verb, and indeed, most dictionary entries for ἔρχομαι will list εἶμι as a possible second principal part:

* ἔρχομαι, ἐλεύσομαι / εἶμι, ἦλθον, ἐλήλυθα, --, -- - to go, to come

Thus, εἶμι follows present tense conjugation patterns, as in the chart above, but is translated using the future tense.

***

## Verb Compounds

Almost any verb in Greek can be turned into a compound verb by adding a preposition as a prefix to the verb. The core meaning of the verb then gets compounded with the meaning or a core concept in the preposition to create verbs with new meanings. For example:

δίδωμι = "to give"
* ἀπό, "(away) from" + δίδωμι = ἀποδίδωμι, "to give away", "to give back", "to return"

τίθημι = "to put, place"
* ἐπί, “on, upon; to, toward, at" + τίθημι = ἐπιτίθημι, "to place upon", "to add to"; (middle voice) "to attack" (+ dative)

Such verbs are called **compound verbs** or **complex verbs**, compared against verbs without a prefix which are called **simplex verbs**. In compounded verbs, the preposition will always be a prefix to the core conjugated form of the verb. This means that if the core verb has, e.g., an augment, the preposition will still be attached *in front of / before* the augment, with any appropriate elisions for the end of the preposition (and any appropriate aspirations of letters before a vowel with a rough breathing). In addition, the accent can not recede to any part of the preposition.

Here are some examples of compounded verbs:

* ἀποδίδωμι > ἀπεδίδουν, 1st sg. imperfect active: "I was giving back"

In this form, note that it's a combination of the prefix ἀπο- and the core verb ἐδίδουν, which begins with the augment ε-. This elides the final -ο- of the ἀπο- prefix, resulting in ἀπεδίδουν.

* ἀπό + ἵημι = ἀφίημι, "to send away", "to release", "to set free"

The prefix ἀπο- gets attached to the core verb ἵημι, which begins with an aspirated ι. The vowel elides the -ο- of ἀπό and adds an aspiration to the existing π ('p'), turning it into a φ ('ph'). Hence: ἀφίημι.

This means that you must be aware of potential prepositional prefixes on verbs and factor them into your consideration of a verb's constituent parts as you figure out what tense it is. For example, you will need to look to the end of a prefix rather than the beginning of the entire verb form to find an augment that indicates that a verb is in an indicative past tense.

The core meanings of compounded verbs can often be gleaned by combining the core meaning of the verb with the core meaning of the preposition, but common uses of these compound verbs, often in the middle voice, will yield translations that take that core meaning to logical conclusions. For example: κατά means "down" while ἵστημι means "to set up" or "make to stand." When you set something down, you "establish" it; thus, καθίστημι can mean "to establish", as a logical conclusion from "to set (ἵστημι) down (κατά)."

The [Unit Vocabulary](#unit-vocabulary) above indicates some examples of compound verbs and translations that may not be immediately apparent from the core meanings of the verbs and their prepositions.

Note also that if a principal part in a verb's dictionary entry has a dash before it (e.g., βαίνω, -βήσομαι, as we'll see in the unit on [athematic aorists](athematic-aorists)), that means that the principal part in question usually appears in Greek literature as a **complex verb**, rarely as a simplex verb; so, you'll often see that principal part and its various conjugations prefixed with a preposition.
