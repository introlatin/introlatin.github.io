# Substantives and Adjectives

This module introduces substantives (people, places, things, or ideas), as denoted by nouns or pronouns; and adjectives, words that modify substantives. Within this module, you'll learn about the declension system, the uses of different cases, how pronouns can replace nouns, and how adjectives modify substantives.
