## Uses of Participles

Participles are **verbal adjectives**, meaning that they tell us more about a noun. At their core, they are descriptive, but as we'll see, based on a participle's position within a sentence, it can also serve additional adverbial purposes, meaning that the participial phrase qualifies the *verb*'s action in addition to modifying a noun.

Because they are derived from verbs, participles can do things like take **direct objects** and **prepositional phrases**. The *actor* of an *active/middle* participle or *the one receiving the action* of a *passive* participle is **the noun that the participle modifies**. We'll illustrate this through the specific examples below.

There are three major ways in which participles can be used and interpreted within a sentence.
* An **attributive participle** acts like a pure adjective and tells us about an action that the modified noun is performing (if active or middle) or that the modified noun is experiencing (if passive).
* A **circumstantial participle**, in addition to modifying a noun, also explains the *circumstances* of the action of a main verb and answer questions like "when did it happen?" or "why did it happen?"
* A **complementary participle**, in addition to modifying a noun, also *completes* the meaning of certain main verbs, including some verbs of speech in a construction called indirect statement.

## Attributive Participles

An **attributive participle** acts like a pure adjective and tells us about an action that the modified noun is performing (if active or middle) or that the modified noun is experiencing (if passive). As the name implies, a participle of this sort is usually (though not always) in [**attributive position**](../nouns/attr-pred#attributive-position). Note the following examples.

* ὁ παῖς **ὁ τοὺς ἵππους ἄγων** τὰ βιβλία φέρει.

The participial phrase here centers on the present active participle ἄγων, which is masculine nominative singular and is in attributive position with the noun that it modifies, ὁ παῖς. Because ἄγων agrees with παῖς and because ἄγων is in the active voice, the action of "leading" in the participle is being performed by the "child." Note also that wedged in between the repeated article and the participle is an accusative direct object, τοὺς ἵππους, that receives the action of "leading" in ἄγων. So, when we put all of those ideas together, we can come up with a translation like this:

* The child **leading the horses** carries the books.

However, this kind of participle translation doesn't necessarily indicate that you understand how the participle relates to the other parts of the sentence: for example, that it is an attributive participle versus a circumstantial participle (which we'll talk about in the next section). So, when you interpret a participle as being an attributive one, one surefire way to communicate that is by translating it as a **relative clause**, a "who", "which", or "that" clause that functions adjectivally to tell us more about a noun:

* The child **who leads the horses** carries the books.

This translation of the participle expands it beyond a simple "[verb]ing" or "[verb]ed" with the addition of a **relative pronoun** ("who", "which", or "that") and the casting of the participle as a conjugated verb ("leads"), and it indicates more clearly how the participle functions within the sentence. The importance of this clarity will become clear once we see how versatile the participle can be in other contexts, as in circumstantial uses of the participle. (We will learn more about relative pronouns and actual relative clauses in the next module.)

* μίκρα τὰ **ὑπὸ τοῦ παῖδος φερόμενα** βιβλία.

In this example, the present passive participle φερόμενα, neuter nominative plural from φέρω, and its genitive of agent ὑπὸ τοῦ παῖδος are in the attributive position between τὰ and its noun βιβλία. Outside of that article-noun phrase is the predicate nominative μίκρα (in [predicative position](../nouns/attr-pred#predicative-position), to form a full sentence).

* The books **that are carried by the child** are small.

Because we have such latitude in translation, there are many possibilities and we don't need to be limited to just one "correct" translation:

* The books **which are carried by the child** are small.
* The books **that are being carried by the child** are small.
etc.

## A Note on Aspect and Relative Tense

Recall that the tense of participles, like the tense infinitives, indicates [**aspect**](infinitive-uses#verbal-aspect) and thus **relative time to the main verb** rather than **absolute time**. While this distinction is difficult to determine with the infinitive constructions that we currently know, it is much clearer with participial expressions that get expanded into dependent clauses.

* ὁ παῖς ὁ τοὺς ἵππους **ἄγων** τὰ βιβλία **φέρει**.
    * The child who **leads** the horses **carries** the books.
* ὁ παῖς ὁ τοὺς ἵππους **ἄγων** τὰ βιβλία **ἤνεγκεν**.
    * The child who **was leading/led** the horses **carried** the books.

**Present aspect** means that the action of the participle is **in progress**, **incomplete**, and **happening at the same time as the main verb**.

In the first sentence, the present participle ἄγων indicates that the action of "leading" occurs at the same time as the main verb φέρει, which is in the present tense. Therefore, ἄγων gets translated with a present verb: "leads."

We use the same present participle ἄγων in the second sentence, but note that the main verb is now the aorist ἤνεγκεν. Because **present aspect** means that the action occurs **at the same time as the main verb**, that means that our translation necessarily needs to reflect that: thus, we get "was leading" or "led" *rather than* the expected "leads". While "led" (a simple past tense) illustrates the idea that the action of "leading" occurs in the past along with the action of "carrying", the translation "was leading" illustrates the same along with also conveying the participle's **in progress** quality.

* ὁ παῖς ὁ τοὺς ἵππους **ἀγαγὼν** τὰ βιβλία **φέρει**.
    * The child who **led** the horses **carries** the books.
* ὁ παῖς ὁ τοὺς ἵππους **ἀγαγὼν** τὰ βιβλία **ἤνεγκεν**.
    * The child who **had led** the horses **carried** the books.

**Aorist aspect** means that the action of the participle is **instantaneous (one and done)**, **completed**, and **happened before the main verb**.

This is easy enough to see in the first sentence, which maintains the same relationship of time that one would expect between aorist and present: "led" is an instantaneous action that is completed and done before the action of "carrying" happens.

However, in the second sentence, notice how the translation of the aorist participle needs to indicate that it happened *before* the aorist main verb. To make this clear, we can use the English **pluperfect** tense ("**had** [verb]**ed**"), which indicates an action that occurred *before* an action in the past.

Whenever you're translating a participle, you must always think in terms of **duration**, **completeness**, and **relative tense**; you can't take "present" or "aorist" at face value necessarily.

## Circumstantial Participles

**Circumstantial participles** perform double duty in a sentence. They both modify a noun *and* explain the **circumstances** of the action of the main verb. They will also usually be placed in **predicative position** to help differentiate them from attributive participles. Participles of this sort often answer questions like "when does the main verb happen?", "why does it happen?", "what obstacles could impede the main verb from happening?", and "under what condition will the main verb happen?" Although there are some clues that may point to one type of circumstantial participle over another, often it will be a matter of personal interpretation, and you have to make a choice as to which of the following translations makes the most sense in the context of what you're reading.

### Temporal
If a circumstantial participle functions in a **temporal** fashion, it is answering the "when" question -- "temporal" derives from the Latin *tempus*, "time". The way that the participle answers the question (i.e., to indicate at what time the main verb occurred) depends on its tense/aspect.

* Either tense of the participle may be translated with **"when"**.
* Present participles may be translated with **"while"** or **"as"**.
* Aorist participles may be translated with **"after"**.

We'll illustrate this idea by using the same sentence with various tenses.

ὁ πολίτης βλέπει τὴν οἰκίαν **ἐρχόμενος ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ**.
* The citizen sees the house **when he comes from the road**.
* The citizen sees the house **while he comes from the road**.
* The citizen sees the house **as he comes from the road**.

In each of these three sample translations, the conjunctions "when", "while", and "as" indicate the relationship of time between the present participle ἐρχόμενος and the main verb βλέπει -- because the participle has present aspect, the two verb actions are happening at the same time.

Notice that because the participle is outside of attributive position, we have to be careful about who/what the participle modifies. Because ἐρχόμενος is masculine nominative singular, the only noun that it can modify is πολίτης -- it is the *citizen* who is coming, not the house (οἰκίαν), which is feminine accusative singular, despite the fact that οἰκίαν is the closest noun to ἐρχόμενος.

ὁ πολίτης βλέπει τὴν οἰκίαν **ἐλθὼν ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ**.
* The citizen sees the house **when he came from the road**.
* The citizen sees the house **after he came from the road**.

In this sentence, we've changed the tense of the participle from present (ἐρχόμενος) to aorist (ἐλθὼν), which indicates a different relationship of time between the participle and the main verb. If we interpret it again as acting temporally (i.e., indicating *when* the action of the main verb occurred), either the conjunction "when" or "after" can make that relationship of time clear: the action of "coming" happened *before* the action of "seeing".

### Causal
If a circumstantial participle acts in a **causal** fashion, then it answers the question "for what reason" or "why is the action of the main verb happening?" As a result, the best subordinating conjunction to use to translate the participle will be **"because"** or **"since"**.

**βλέψας τοὺς ἵππους**, ὁ ἀνὴρ εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν ἦλθεν.
* **Because he saw the horses**, the man went into the house.

The reason that the man went into the house is given by the participle **βλέψας** -- he performed the action of "going" *because* he saw the horses.

A causal participle can occasionally be prefaced with a **particle** that indicates that you should interpret it in a causal fashion as opposed to temporal, concessive, or conditional: **ὡς**, **ἅτε**, or **οἷα**.

ὁ ἄδικος ἐν τῇ δίκῃ βλέπεται **ὡς ἀδικήσας** τοὺς πολίτας.
* The unjust man is being seen at the trial **because** he wronged the citizens.

### Concessive
If a circumstantial participle acts in a **concessive** fashion, then it is explaining an obstacle that would get in the way of the performance of the main verb. As a result, the best subordinating conjunction to use to translate the participle will be **"although"**, **"even though"**, or **"though"**.

τὸ ἔργον οὐ **βλέψας**, ὁ ἀνὴρ ἐθέλει περὶ αὐτῷ εἰπεῖν.
* **Even though he didn't see the deed**, the man wants to talk about it.

The man was not a witness to the deed, but *despite* that fact, which might prevent one from speaking knowledgeably about it, the man nevertheless wants to talk about it. The participle explains an obstacle that should get impede the performance of the main verb.

Like causal participles, concessive participles have a clue **particle** that lets you know that you should interpret it as concessive rather than temporal, causal, or conditional: **καίπερ**. In addition, the *main* clause of a sentence that contains a concessive participle might also include the adverb **ὅμως**, which means "nevertheless" or "still." So, we can rewrite the sentence above as follows:

**καίπερ** τὸ ἔργον οὐ **βλέψας**, ὁ ἀνὴρ **ὅμως** ἐθέλει περὶ αὐτῷ εἰπεῖν.
* **Although he didn't see the deed**, the man **nevertheless** wants to talk about it.

### Conditional
If a circumstantial participle acts in a **conditional** fashion, then it is explaining a condition that the main verb needs to be met in order to be performed. As a result, the best subordinating conjunction to use to translate the participle will be **"if"**.

ὁ μαθητὴς καλὰ ποιήματα γράφει **τὰ βιβλία φέρων**.
* The student writes good poems **if he brings his books**.

Conditionals ("if...then" statements) are actually a discrete syntactic topic that we will discuss in the second semester once we learn about the subjunctive and the optative moods of the verb. For now, it's enough to know that you can approximate a conditional by using a participle.

### Genitive Absolute

One special use of a circumstantial participle, in any of its four interpretations above (temporal, causal, concessive, or conditonal), is in a construction called the **genitive absolute**. In all of the above examples, the participle modified an explicit part of the main sentence, like a subject or a direct object. A **genitive absolute**, however, uses **a substantive in the genitive case and a participle that agrees with it in gender, case, and number** to explain the circumstances around the action of the main verb, much like a regular circumstantial participle. The key difference, however, is that the genitive substantive does not bear any syntactic relationship to the main clause: the participle is not an action done by or done to a subject, direct object, etc., in the main clause.

**τῶν ἵππων ἀπὸ τῆς ὁδοῦ αχθέντων**, οἱ ἄνδρες τὸν οἶνον ἔμειξαν.
* **After the horses had been led away from the road**, the men mixed the wine. (temporal)
* **Because the horses had been led away from the road**, the men mixed the wine. (causal)
* etc.

The participle of the **genitive absolute** functions like a regular circumstantial participle: you can interpret it as functioning temporally, causally, concessively, or conditionally, and it's best translated with a full subordinate clause with an appropriate conjunction for your interpretation. You just have to be aware that instead of looking for a core part of the sentence for the participle to modify, the participle of the genitive absolute will be modifying a genitive subtantive as its actor (if active/middle) or acted-upon (if passive).

## Complementary Participles

**Complementary participles** complete the sense of a main verb that needs a complement. Although we've encountered this idea before with [complementary infinitives](infinitive-uses#complementary-infinitive), there are certain verbs that require a **participle** rather than an infinitive to complete them, like the two in the [Unit Vocabulary](#unit-vocabulary) above: ἄρχω, "to begin", and παύω, "to stop".

Because the action in the participle will often be performed by or upon the subject of the sentence, it will often be in the **nominative** case.

* αἱ γυναῖκες ἄρχουσι **τὰ ὅπλα λαμβάνουσαι**. The women begin **taking the weapons**.
* οἱ δικασταὶ ἐπαύσαντο\* **τοὺς τοῦ ἀδίκου λόγους ἀκούοντες**. The jurors stopped **listening to the unjust man's words**.

\* Note that παύω has a strong difference in meaning depending on whether it is in the **active** or **middle** voice. In the **active**, it means "to stop [someone else, in the **accusative** case] from [participle]-ing". In the **middle**, though, it means "to stop [oneself, no extra words needed] [participle]-ing." So, note in how the example above, the jurors are stopping themselves from listening, rather than stopping anyone else from doing so.

### Preview of Indirect Statement

One special use of complementary participles is in a construction called **indirect statement**, in which someone's words or thoughts are expressed through the filter of a main verb that is performed with the head (verbs like "to say", "to think", "to know", "to hear", "to show", etc.). Here's an English example:

* The just person heard that the citizen had done evil things.

The "that" clause is an **indirect statement**, the *direct* version of which would be "The citizen had done evil things." However, here, it is a subordinate clause that depends on the main clause, "The just person heard."

There are three ways to indicate an indirect statement in Greek, one of which is by using a **complementary participle** in the accusative case (with an accusative noun to serve as its actor or acted-upon if needed). Thus:

* ὁ δίκαιος ἤκουσε **τὸν πολίτην κακὰ ποιήσαντα**.

We will explore this construction in much more detail in the next module, when we'll tackle all three methods of indirect statement at the same time.
