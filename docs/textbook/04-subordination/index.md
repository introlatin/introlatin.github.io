# Subordination

This module introduces methods of creating complex sentences, wherein a dependent clause or verbal unit helps answer a question posed by a main clause. Some constructions that we'll discuss include indirect statement and purpose clauses, and in so doing, we'll learn about two new verb moods, the subjunctive and the optative, and when we should use them according to the sequence of moods.
